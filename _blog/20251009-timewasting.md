Often I work on writing games to procrastinate when I should be working on assignments or reading for my university course. But now I have completed the MVP (Minimal Viable product) for my assignments all due in the comming days, and now am just waiting for some admin - so I don't feel as motivated to work on writing this game.


# Journal draft #

I started a draft of the journal (001-journal.txt), and think I should focus on the BITE (Behaviour, Information, Thought and Emotional control) test of authoritian control, or start to show in the later 2 weeks or so our character doing that.


I think the character will be naemd - Idris Floyd (initials IDF), and onthe flight home he sits next to a young likely 3rd or 4th year psychology student. Likely because he just has his notebook opened to the email from LaRouche "The secret of statecraft" and she notices how it is cohersive in nature (and he has been staring at nothing or the page for over 30 minutes) - that leads to her asking something, just to check if he is ok.
The email is likely from late July early August 2004 (the time of the Democratic Natioanl Convention in Boston was 26-29 July).




Meanwhile Idris is sitting in the field where they share metro cards (4 cards means 4 members go back to the office, one travels back to the site to bring another 3 back with them - Idris occasionally walks an hour or so (he guesses 5km) because it is just as fast some days). He walks Berri-UQAM to Jarry Metros.

Then he is locked out. He walks to the house...

That is why he finally makes the change of booking. When he calls it is super easy, he has a booking to leave Montreal tomorrow...
in flashbacks he has the choice to mess with Doug's bookings, or charge his card.
