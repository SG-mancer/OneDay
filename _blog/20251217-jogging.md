Still procrastinating, two units over the summer, assessments and reading I should be doing, and I am focusing hours on this game.

Wrote a sequence to start the game.
You figure out there must be a ticket home as you go for a nightly jog.

```
It’s become routine. Shoes laced, out the door. You’d call it your house, but really it’s a mattress under a table in the boot room.
Running started practical—something to do on the way home, a way to burn off frustration. You asked, carefully, for more pay so everyone could eat better. Failing that, you asked for stability. A plan. Something solid.

When that failed, you asked for help outright. That went worse. They sent you to the others—the original twelve—as if exhaustion could be peer-reviewed. What came back wasn’t clarity but judgment.
Your jog start under the A-40, the elevated highway reduced at night to a low, constant hum, and loop around the parks in Villeray–Saint-Michel.
You tried other angles. A change of office. A temporary reassignment. Even a flight home—anything to break the loop. Each request stalled in non-answers. Every follow-up produced assurances, then nothing at all.

By the time you finished the jog and drifted back toward the house, the idea had hardened into resolve.
Inside, you stay quiet. After your shower, you search your things—papers folded and unfolded, pockets checked twice. You look again where it should be: with your passport and the emergency documents and cash you prepared before departing.

You stop searching and realize the obvious: after all these months in North America, all your belongings still fit in a single bag.
You’re already packed.

I have even shortened this more, and in the next section try to
