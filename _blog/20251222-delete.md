I cleared my browsing histories and cookies, because I couldn't access flights.google.com - and it deleted almost all of my twine stories.
Now I just have the one story remaining, Circe.

I'm ok with that. This game has an ok structure, and some notes that feel worth while.

I spent yesterday trying to decide if I should have the flights home via Dubai, or Polynesia to make it two distinct long legs.

The game's inciting incident is a bit unrealistic, in that the character just grabs everything then goes to get their flights changed. But I want something that makes it likely the player doesn't have to interact with the political party.
