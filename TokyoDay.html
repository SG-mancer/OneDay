[[Haneda Airport]] </tw-passagedata><tw-passagedata pid="41" name="::: ChatGPT guidance ::" tags="" position="17475,7800" size="100,100">What would a Type 2, who is in stress acting like an 8 think if they believed they were a 5 acting in growth?
ChatGPT
A Type 2 under stress often exhibits behaviors associated with Type 8, becoming more assertive, controlling, and possibly aggressive as a way to protect themselves and cope with feelings of vulnerability and rejection. However, if this Type 2 mistakenly believes they are a Type 5 in growth, they might misinterpret their behaviors and motivations. Here’s how this misunderstanding might manifest and what they might think:

Behaviors and Misinterpretations
1. Assertiveness and Control (Type 8 under Stress)
Behavior: The Type 2 becomes more assertive, confrontational, and seeks to control situations and relationships to protect themselves from further hurt.
Misinterpretation as Type 5 in Growth: They might see their increased assertiveness and desire for control as a form of seeking autonomy and independence, which they mistakenly attribute to Type 5&#39;s growth.
2. Withdrawal and Independence (Type 8 under Stress)
Behavior: The Type 2 might withdraw emotionally and become more self-reliant, distancing themselves from others to avoid vulnerability.
Misinterpretation as Type 5 in Growth: They might believe this withdrawal and self-reliance are signs of Type 5’s characteristic independence and need for personal space and intellectual exploration.
3. Focus on Self-Sufficiency (Type 8 under Stress)
Behavior: The Type 2 starts prioritizing their own needs and desires, perhaps aggressively pursuing their goals without seeking help from others.
Misinterpretation as Type 5 in Growth: They might interpret this focus on self-sufficiency as a move towards the Type 5’s emphasis on competence and knowledge.
Emotional and Psychological Impact
1. Confusion about Motivations
Type 2 Core Motivation: The need to be loved and appreciated by helping others.
Type 8 Stress Response: Acting out of a need to protect oneself and assert control.
Type 5 Growth Misinterpretation: They might confuse their stress-induced assertiveness as a healthy move towards Type 5’s detachment and intellectualism, leading to confusion about their true motivations and feelings.
2. Misalignment in Self-Perception
Identity Conflict: Believing they are a Type 5 in growth, they might focus on developing intellectual skills and independence, which might not address their underlying emotional needs as a Type 2.
Emotional Disconnect: This misalignment could lead to frustration and further emotional disconnect, as their actions do not genuinely align with their core needs and desires.
Potential Misunderstandings
1. Intellectual Pursuits vs. Emotional Connection
Type 2 under Stress: Might pursue control and assertiveness in relationships.
Belief as Type 5: They might incorrectly focus on intellectual pursuits, thinking they are growing, while neglecting their need for emotional connection and support.
2. Independence vs. Relational Health
Type 2 under Stress: Prioritizes self-reliance to protect against vulnerability.
Belief as Type 5: They might interpret this as a healthy independence, missing the opportunity to address and heal their relational wounds and needs for connection.
Growth Strategies for Realignment
1. Self-Awareness and Reflection
Reflection: Encourage regular self-reflection to understand true motivations and needs. Journaling or therapy can help uncover underlying Type 2 needs.
Awareness: Developing awareness of stress responses and distinguishing them from genuine growth behaviors.

Why would a type 2 who is mostly acting a stress position 8, be a good commercial airline pilot?

ChatGPT
A Type 2 (The Helper) who is mostly acting in a stress position 8 (The Challenger) could also be a good commercial airline pilot, albeit for somewhat different reasons. When a Type 2 adopts the behaviors of a Type 8 under stress, they become more assertive, decisive, and authoritative—traits that are highly valuable in the role of a commercial airline pilot. Here’s why a Type 2 in a stress position 8 could excel in this profession:

1. Decisiveness and Authority
Clear Decision-Making: Acting like a Type 8, a Type 2 would exhibit strong decision-making abilities and the confidence to take charge, especially in high-pressure situations. This is crucial for a pilot, who must make quick and accurate decisions for the safety of the flight.
Leadership Skills: The authoritative and commanding presence of a Type 8 can help a stressed Type 2 effectively lead the cockpit crew and maintain control over the flight operations.
2. Assertiveness and Confidence
Commanding Respect: The assertiveness that comes with a Type 8 behavior can help a Type 2 command respect from passengers and crew. This is important for maintaining order and ensuring that safety protocols are followed.
Handling Emergencies: In emergency situations, the confidence and assertiveness of a Type 8 can be invaluable. A stressed Type 2 would be more likely to take decisive action and remain calm under pressure, ensuring the safety and well-being of everyone on board.
3. Protectiveness and Responsibility
Passenger Safety: Even under stress, a Type 2’s underlying motivation to help and protect others remains. Combined with Type 8&#39;s protective instincts, this can translate into a strong commitment to passenger safety and well-being.
Crew Support: Their protective nature would also extend to the flight crew, ensuring a supportive and secure working environment where everyone feels valued and safe.
4. Goal-Oriented Focus
Achieving Objectives: The goal-oriented and driven nature of a Type 8 can help a stressed Type 2 focus on achieving the objectives of each flight, such as on-time departures and arrivals, maintaining safety standards, and ensuring passenger satisfaction.
Efficiency: This focus can also enhance operational efficiency, leading to smoother and more effective flight operations.
5. Resilience and Adaptability
Handling Stress: The resilience associated with Type 8 behaviors can help a stressed Type 2 handle the demands and stress of being a pilot more effectively. They can adapt to changing conditions and unforeseen challenges with greater ease.
Stress Management: While the shift to Type 8 behaviors is a stress response, it can also provide the strength and resilience needed to manage the high-stress environment of aviation.
Potential Challenges and Mitigation
1. Over-Control and Aggression
Challenge: The stressed Type 2 might become overly controlling or aggressive, which can create tension with the crew and passengers.
Mitigation: Developing self-awareness and stress management techniques can help mitigate this tendency, allowing them to channel their assertiveness in positive ways.
2. Neglecting Emotional Needs
Challenge: Under stress, they might neglect their own emotional needs and the emotional needs of others, focusing too much on control and efficiency.
Mitigation: Regular self-reflection and practices like mindfulness or therapy can help them stay connected to their empathetic Type 2 nature, ensuring they balance assertiveness with compassion.
3. Maintaining Balance
Challenge: Balancing the assertiveness of Type 8 with the nurturing tendencies of Type 2 can be difficult, leading to internal conflict.
Mitigation: Seeking support from mentors or peers and practicing balanced leadership can help them integrate these aspects of their personality more effectively.
Conclusion
A Type 2 who is mostly acting in a stress position 8 could be a good commercial airline pilot because the traits they exhibit under stress—decisiveness, assertiveness, confidence, and protectiveness—are highly valuable in aviation. By recognizing and managing potential challenges, they can leverage these strengths to excel in their role, ensuring the safety and satisfaction of their passengers and crew.

Madison is a Type 9 - who will likely help Austin discover himself...

https://www.enneagraminstitute.com/type-8/
Austin is acting like a Type 8.
He thinks it is because he is a Type 5 acting in a type of Growth, but he is really a Type 2 in Stress
&quot;&quot; Level 3: Attain skillful mastery of whatever interests them. Excited by knowledge: often become expert in some field. Innovative and inventive, producing extremely valuable, original works. Highly independent, idiosyncratic, and whimsical. &quot;&quot;
https://www.enneagraminstitute.com/type-5/
&quot;&quot;Level 5: Become overly intimate and intrusive: they need to be needed, so they hover, meddle, and control in the name o:f love. Want others to depend on them: give, but expect a return: send double messages. Enveloping and possessive: the codependent, self-sacrificial person who cannot do enough for others—wearing themselves out for everyone, creating needs for themselves to fulfill.&quot;&quot;

&quot;&quot;  Surprisingly, it is more likely for some Fives to be mistaken for Twos, but only in very narrow circumstances. Because Fives do not form emotional bonds easily, they can be highly dependent on the few they do form, and can become needy with their significant others. At such times, they do not want their loved ones far from them, somewhat like average Twos. &quot;&quot;
&quot;&quot;  Twos are emotionally expressive and highly people-oriented. Fives are emotionally detached and can be the true loners of the Enneagram. Both feel rejected easily, but Twos cope by winning people over and Fives cope by detaching from the hurt and isolating themselves further.  &quot;&quot;

Type 8 &quot;Level 4: Self-sufficiency, financial independence, and having enough resources are important concerns: become enterprising, pragmatic, “rugged individualists,” wheeler-dealers. Risk-taking, hardworking, denying own emotional needs.&quot;


---
Type One is principled, purposeful, self-controlled, and perfectionistic.

Type Two is generous, demonstrative, people-pleasing, and possessive.

Type Three is adaptable, excelling, driven, and image-conscious.

Type Four is expressive, dramatic, self-absorbed, and temperamental.

Type Five is perceptive, innovative, secretive, and isolated.

Type Six is engaging, responsible, anxious, and suspicious.

Type Seven is spontaneous, versatile, acquisitive, and scattered.

Type Eight is self-confident, decisive, willful, and confrontational.

Type Nine is receptive, reassuring, complacent, and resigned.

Would the Type 9 perceive that the Type 8 is actually a 2 in stress?
ChatGPT
It&#39;s possible for a Type 9 to perceive that a Type 8 is actually exhibiting behaviors of a Type 2 in stress, especially if they are attuned to the nuances of the Enneagram system and familiar with the dynamics between different types. Here&#39;s how a Type 9 might come to this perception:

Observation of Behavior: A Type 9, known for their ability to observe and empathize with others, may notice certain behaviors in the Type 8 that resemble those of a Type 2 in stress. This could include traits such as over-involvement in others&#39; affairs, controlling tendencies, or a focus on asserting dominance or authority.

Empathy and Understanding: Drawing from their own empathy and understanding of human nature, a Type 9 may recognize that the Type 8&#39;s behavior is driven by underlying fears or insecurities, similar to those experienced by a Type 2 in stress. They may sense that the Type 8 is seeking validation or affirmation through their actions, rather than acting from a place of genuine confidence or self-assuredness.

Awareness of Enneagram Dynamics: If the Type 9 is knowledgeable about the Enneagram system and how different types interact with each other, they may be able to identify patterns in the Type 8&#39;s behavior that align with the stress and growth dynamics of the Enneagram model. They may understand that the Type 8&#39;s assertiveness and need for control are responses to stressors, rather than inherent traits of their personality.

Comparison to Healthy Type 2 Behavior: By contrasting the Type 8&#39;s current behavior with the healthy expression of Type 2 traits, a Type 9 may recognize discrepancies or inconsistencies that suggest the Type 8 is operating from a state of stress rather than growth. They may notice that the Type 8&#39;s actions lack the genuine warmth, empathy, and selflessness typically associated with a healthy Type 2.

Intuitive Insight: Finally, a Type 9&#39;s intuitive insight and ability to perceive underlying motivations and emotions in others may lead them to intuitively sense that the Type 8 is experiencing stress and insecurity, even if the Type 8 themselves may not be fully aware of it.

Overall, a Type 9 may perceive that a Type 8 is actually exhibiting behaviors of a Type 2 in stress based on their observations, empathy, understanding of Enneagram dynamics, comparison to healthy Type 2 behavior, and intuitive insight into the Type 8&#39;s underlying motivations and emotions.

Lets say the three have only known each other for 9hours. Maybe they have seen each other at a party before, but the Type 8 (who is really a type 2 in systematic continuous stress) booked the layover thinking it would be a good chance to get status of having visited a new city and doing something exciting. The Type 2, is tired having not slept much, and the Type 9 has just met the Type 8 for the first time. What things would the Type 9 perceive or be able to observe (as an astute in tune person to the Enneagram system) and point out to help the Type 8 open up and see he is stressed?
ChatGPT
In this scenario, the Type 9, being perceptive and attuned to the nuances of human behavior and the Enneagram system, may notice certain signs and behaviors in the Type 8 (actually a Type 2 in continuous stress) that suggest underlying stress or insecurity. Here are some observations and insights the Type 9 might be able to point out to help the Type 8 recognize their stress:

Overcompensation for Approval: The Type 9 may observe that the Type 8 is putting excessive effort into planning and organizing the layover activities, perhaps in an attempt to gain validation or approval from the group. They may notice signs of perfectionism or control in the Type 8&#39;s behavior, indicating a desire to be seen as competent or capable.

Discomfort with Vulnerability: Despite their assertive exterior, the Type 9 may sense that the Type 8 is uncomfortable with vulnerability or emotional intimacy. They may detect subtle signs of defensiveness or deflection when personal topics are broached, suggesting that the Type 8 is avoiding deeper emotional connections.

Avoidance of Rest: The Type 9 may observe that the Type 8 is reluctant to acknowledge their own fatigue or need for rest, instead prioritizing excitement and activity during the layover. They may notice subtle cues such as fatigue or irritability in the Type 8&#39;s demeanor, indicating that they may be pushing themselves beyond their limits.

Focus on External Validation: The Type 9 may notice that the Type 8 seeks validation or affirmation from others, perhaps through boasting about their accomplishments or seeking admiration for their adventurous spirit. They may observe a pattern of seeking external validation to bolster their self-esteem, rather than deriving fulfillment from within.

Tendency to Control Situations: The Type 9 may recognize that the Type 8 exhibits a strong need for control or dominance within the group dynamics. They may notice that the Type 8 is quick to assert their opinions or preferences, perhaps at the expense of considering others&#39; viewpoints or desires.

Resistance to Relaxation: Despite the laid-back nature of the Type 9, they may observe that the Type 8 struggles to relax or unwind during the layover. They may notice signs of restlessness or agitation in the Type 8&#39;s behavior, indicating that they may have difficulty letting go of their need for constant activity or stimulation.

By pointing out these observations and insights to the Type 8, the Type 9 can help them recognize and acknowledge their stress levels and the underlying motivations driving their behavior. This awareness can be a crucial first step towards addressing their stress and finding healthier ways to cope and connect with others.</tw-passagedata><tw-passagedata pid="42" name=":Sydney Airport Terminal?" tags="" position="18250,8925" size="100,100">

	Leaving a cult is often a drawn out and difficult process.
	The most common reason for leaving is disillusionment with either the leadership or other group members.
	These are &quot;Push factors&quot; and serve to drive the individual away from the group. Once they begin to take effect &quot;pull factors&quot; such as relationships with family and friends become much more impactful.
	
	If they are mainly motivated by companionship and the need to belong to a group they are also highly vulnerable to disillusionment if the friends the group or the leaders do not live up to the high expectations of friendship loyalty and leadership.
	When disillusionment took place a dismissal of the group&#39;s narative also followed.
	
	The narative is - an economic collapse will happen because of the rotten economy.
	
	pseudo-personality (that ingested the cult&#39;s bullshit/lies) and the pre-cult personality. To aid in the post-cult identity is aided by chewing the introjected (gestalt process) part being broken down - any positive or nourishing aspects retained and toxic or harmful elements discarded.
	
	impacts range from low self-esteem, increased narcissism and depression to the more abstract - such as users having a tendency to jump to incorrect conculsions about other users social, physical and moral qualities.

Shane then explained intention to him and got a small donation from the guy.
	
	We then moved out table two or three blocks down the street to a busy intersection catching people going home or to their arvo shift job. Shane called out to a guy who shouted back &quot;I don&#39;t give a stuff about any of the people!&quot;, Shane challenged him and he came back a second latter. Shane got him to explain why he doesn&#39;t care about people, he explained his story about having to pay huge court fines and being unemployed and now not caring about anything (how he was an underdog) Shane then told him &quot;I knew you cared about something&quot;, and the guy then asked Shane what he was doing, and after explaining why he was on the street (to organise the people to care in a more directed way) the guy asked about what was going on politically, then about our philosophy leading into a good five-ten minute discussion.

	&quot;The secret of statecraft, as distinct from mere politics, is the work of raising the level of more and more parts of the population from their accustomed small-mindedness and intellectual mediocrity, to a sense of the beauty of ideas of principle. Populism, which is the generic name f:or those doses of mediocrity by which oligarchs turn most ordinary people into bleating sheep (to be herded by nasty beasts), induces people to dumb themselves down into an approximation of herded cattle...&quot;

	&quot;On Australia&#39;s Identity
	
	If you&#39;re asking the typical question &quot;What does LaRouche have to do with Australia?,&quot; or &quot;Why are you working with an American?,&quot; then you need a dose of healthy truth. As you read LaRouche in dialogue with the Australian youth committed to creating a Renaissance, ask yourself, &quot;What am I doing for future generations?&quot;
	
	Then, once you think you know what the purpose of the LYM is, read LaRouche&#39;s dialogue with the LYM: &quot;The Principle of &#39;Power&#39;&quot;
	
	Lyndon LaRouche&#39;s message to the Labor Day cadre school, March 6 2004.
	
	&quot;Well, you&#39;ve got quite a job to do. If you&#39;ve got 40, you&#39;ve got the base for building something. Because it takes class sizes of 15 to 25, to do any real intellectual work of any importance to a youth movement. You have to think of a youth movement as a university-on-wheels, which is somewhat like a regular university, except the people in it generally work harder at knowledge, than people in universities do. People in universities tend to be very lazy. They get habits, they get routines. They try to pick up learning, rather than actually going through the process of discovering knowledge. Whereas young people who will go through the Socratic method of Plato, starting from rather elementary questions, to build up actual discoveries of knowledge-they work much harder. They have much better motivation. And they develop much better moral character.

	The LaRouche Youth Movement last week deployed to Canberra to leave the politicians and the population with a Christmas present- EIRs and New Citizen Extras. The visit was short and powerful, lasting three days.
	The first two mornings commenced early, hitting the Bus stations, Department of Foreign Affairs and Trade (DFAT), the Governor Generals Department, the Prime Ministers, Treasury and Finance departments.
	EIRs were on the agenda and we set out to saturate and mobilise the population.
	At DFAT, Kat and Brian had a guy who asked for two papers so he could give one to the Labor Party. When Kat asked if he did that last time he replied, &quot;I do it every time. It&#39;s a good read&quot;.
	Some people at DFAT didn&#39;t think it was a good read. A security guard approached Kat and Brian asking them to step aside from where they were deploying so he could have a word.
	&quot;There&#39;s been a report that you have been calling people a**holes. Is this true?&quot; Kat told him, &quot;If we did what you accuse us of, it would be counter productive to what they were doing.&quot; The security guard said that he didn&#39;t think we would do that as our visits are frequent, and we don&#39;t usually cause trouble.
	At the buses, Adam had a person take an EIR, then come back to him after reading a few pages and told him that he agrees with what we were saying.
	Another person Adam spoke to heard we were accused of being fascist but agreed with everything that came out of Adam&#39;s mouth!
	We are noticing a lot, particularly as a result of our regular organising of the population with the NC, shifts in the mindset of the population.
	Following the early morning deployments, we set up two tables in the mall. Both days we had balloons and a party-style atmosphere, wearing Christmas hats and giving Canberra a Christmas present -Dick Cheney&#39;s departure, and soon to follow, Johnny Howard&#39;s departure.
	We had a lady who kept coming back to the table to talk to us and put in a donation each time. Aaron and Matt who spoke to her said, &quot;It was like she was doing a donation just to talk to us.&quot; She took an EIR and several NC&#39;s.
	On the second day in the mall, Daniel met a guy who put in for an EIR, left his contact details and took not one, but four bundles of New Citizen Extra&#39;s which was a great help to us.
	Doug spoke to a lady who had read the NC before and loved it. She contributed and encouraged us to keep up the fine work.
	Kat had a similar incident where a lady had read our material about a year ago and wanted to sign up as a member but lost our contact details. She did a membership and got the literature she needed to get active in politics.
	Kat spoke to a guy from the navy, who thought he already had the New Citizen she was handing him. He took it when he discovered that he didn&#39;t have that issue. They discussed the urgent need to get a new economic system, as per LaRouche&#39;s proposal and agreed that Cheney had to go.
	The Youth did letter-boxing in the regions of Canberra, and Albury and Wodonga on the way back to Melbourne, getting out over 8000 NC&#39;s. Overall, a productive week of mass distribution.

	This was the first week that the LYM has spent in Melbourne for quite a few weeks, and was more than eventful with three interventions (including one with Scott Ritter, one at a state conference for the ALP and an intervention against a pro- free trade conference) and several meetings with state MP&#39;s to discuss the passing of an amendment to the existing [Crimes (Homicide) Bill], which legalises murder &quot;If the person carrying out the conduct reasonably believes that …The conduct is a reasonable response to the emergency.&quot; We also had one of our contacts, Lars from WA, over for the week, and stepped up our intellectual routine to account for a shortage of time whilst travelling and the like. On Tuesday night the LYM members were inspired to stay up to past three am reading Plato&#39;s Phaedo dialogue, in which Plato develops the conception of immortality.
	The LYM started the week by mobilising to get out as many of our last NCE&#39;s in Melbourne as was humanly possible. We did this with great success, having literature towers set up on more than one day and getting very polarised reactions about LaRouche, ranging from the occasional freak-out by pro- free trade members of the 68er generation to one case when a complete stranger whom we had met over a month ago, gave Doug and Kat a free lift back to our bus.
	The highlight though, was, without doubt, the intervention with Scott Ritter, former UN weapons inspector and opponent to the Iraq war. This was an entirely new experience for our newest recruit Daniel, as well as Lars. After Scott Ritter&#39;s speech, in the Question and Answers section, we got a chance to ask him what he thought about LaRouche, to which he replied: &quot;No comment&quot;!! Members of the LYM approached him in the aisle, and Rachael asked him what he thought about the Cheney/torture question. Ritter, being an ex-intelligence operator and soldier, reacted violently against what Cheney is doing. As the discussion started to take off, one of the events organisers pulled Ritter away from us to go upstairs to his book signing. Kat and Aaron out-flanked Ritter again when they went to buy a copy of his book, &quot;Iraq Confidential&quot; for our library. When asked who to make it out to, Aaron replied, the &quot; LaRouche Youth Movement.&#39; Kat presented him with the Cheney torture EIR. Ritter said that he had already got one and that he reads EIR every week on the Internet. He also said that he speaks to one of our phone organisers in the US every week. Kat got him to sign an EIR for us as well, which is going into our library. They were then asked to move so that the book-signing could continue.
	The intervention at the state conference of the ALP was definitely one to remember, with the LYM singing canons such as, &quot;End Impotence in the ALP, go back to Curtin, and Ben Chifley,&quot; and &quot;End speculation, get a New Bretton Woods, Like LaRouche has said, Rebuild the world.&quot; We had very good responses (bar the occasional impotent unionist), especially from older members of the Labor Party who personally remember the legacies of men like Curtin. Doug had long conversations with a number of State MP&#39;s concerning the work that the LYM is doing in the U.S. with the UAW, (United Auto-motive Workers) including the rally we had with them on Capitol Hill. One bewildered MP replied that Lyn &quot;needs more real life experience&quot; to which Doug replied, &quot;Oh, he has plenty of that.&quot; We were in many ways the life of the party, to the extent that when Kat was waiting in queue to get some food, every single other person in the line was discussing LaRouche&#39;s campaign in the U.S. which most are knowledgeable about due to the links between the ALP and the Democrats. We got out a bundle or so of LaRouche&#39;s program for America.

	 What Gauss attacked, specifically, was Euler’s and Lagrange’s fraudulent evasion of the fact that their false argument depended axiomatically on “ivory tower” adherence to the prescriptions of a Cartesian geometry. What Gauss had demonstrated in his 1799 paper on the fundamental theorem, is that the real universe, the physical universe, does not conform to a mathematics premised on the assumed self-evidence of Cartesian geometric assumptions, but, rather, a different universe, that of the complex domain, in which Leibniz’s universal physical principle of least action occupies a central position.

	The ALYM claims that its membership grew during the 2004 federal election campaign, during which they worked for CEC candidates in three election campaigns in the Melbourne region, in Maribyrnong, Calwell and Melbourne Ports, where they went door-to-door handing out copies of the election edition of the New Citizen, which featured articles on the fight for a National Bank in Australia and the founding of the Australian Liberal Party in the 1940s, and explaining the potential of &quot;LaRouche&#39;s New Bretton Woods&quot; and the &quot;dirty state of the Australian political scene&quot;.
	
	Twelve ALYM members ran for the House of Representatives and for the Senate in Victoria at the 2004 election. They also managed three flagship campaigns in the Melbourne Region, including the campaign of Aaron Isherwood, himself a member of the ALYM, standing against Michael Danby (long parliament&#39;s only Jewish MP and a well-known LaRouche opponent) in the seat of Melbourne Ports. All candidates were unsuccessful.

	To LaRouche followers, baby boomers are a lost cause. “I can’t stress this enough, baby boomers are insane,” Hamler says. “They say: ‘Don’t mess with this LaRouche guy. You can’t endanger my comfort zone.’ They look at their kids as objects.”
	
	LaRouche followers are big on doubling the square. Outside the room where LaRouche just spoke is a signboard marked with a square and the teasing question: “Can you double this square?” As Hamler leads a reporter through trying to double the square, a small crowd gathers. 
	
	The cheerful young men clearly relish this exercise. It’s an important recruiting tool on street corners and college campuses across the United States and Europe. To join forces with LaRouche — to enter his world of conspiracies and counter-conspiracies — you have to accept that everything you know, even the way you think, is wrong.
	
	“They say things like LaRouche is a leader of a cult or that he is anti-Semitic, or some other vile epithet,” the release says. “Don’t be fooled by these rumors and lies.” They originate from Gestapo-style “thought police”, and the families of the financial oligarchy who “exert control over politics in the US, through the top-down management of ‘approved’ popular beliefs…”
	
	
From Wikipedia::

	The LaRouche Youth Movement is a movement created by Lyndon LaRouche, with many branchs throughout the world, including the Australian LaRouche Youth Movement.
	
	The Main role of the Australian LaRouche Youth Movement is to generate politcal interest umongst the public. What is why during the 2004 Australian Election they door knocked three electorates, and regulary have tables upon campuses, student meetings and rallys. 
	
	Hisotry
	
	the following is the story of the LaRouche Youth Movement in Australia, pretty much blow by blow. Up until roughly two years ago (December 2003)
	
	For security names have not been revealed.
	
	
	Phase One: where the force sort of gets formed.
	
	The “Youth Movement” was formed in Australia on some otherwise uneventful day in August 2002. When four young members of the Citizens Electoral Council were (as some will say) “thrown together”. The original four, consisted of CC who had been on the field team, JL who had been in admin, and DM and RM who had been in intel.
	
	This orginal team was then complemented within a month with two Tasmanians, CP and SL. Then in November with another two members, being WL (the brother of SL) and KI (the son of the CEC&#39;s founder, and the middle child at that). The shift then started to change towards organising for the New South Wales State Elections in March 2003, where the Flagship Campaign for the CEC was to be Maitland.
	
	In January the whole of the CEC including the youth movement went to Maitland, where they started to systematically doorknock the electorate and started to kick up a storm to try and get our candiate elected. The three month campaign was broken for the “Youth Movement” by a trip to the USA.
	
	So after the campaign the crew then returned to Melbourne (minus CP, who had quit with the end of the campaign), where they started to hit the University Campuses to try and recruit more “Youth Movement” members.
	
	Phase Two: where forces reaches eight again.
	
	After basically a month of organising on campuses, where the force of seven set up tables and tried to get students interested in what is happening around them. It is sort of ironic, that their next member was neither a University Student, nor recruited during the semester. KR, was recruited for the first trip since Maitland, being a trip to Canberra in June 2003, to get out the new Children of Satan pamphlet.
	
	The CEC office also put on a performance of Schiller&#39;s “Joan d&#39;Art” at the July Confrence 2003, in which all of the Youth Movement Members played roles: JL playing Joan d&#39;Art.
	
	
	Phase Three: A Cadre School.
	
	Then an idea hit the CEC, that after a year of organising on Universities that having a Student only conference (or a Cadre School) at a camp in Anglesea would be the way to boost their numbers above eight members. Many weeks of organising went into aranging for students to come, and then when the main International guests Leini Rubinstien arrived and whipped them into a phoning frenzy for the last week to aim at doubling the number of people attending. Also for the Cadre School BM from Philadelphia LYM local came down as well as Leni from the LA LaRouche campaign office.
	
	The Cadre School was a huge success in recruiting people, DA a contact from the Maitland campaign finished his year at University then joined. AR a contact from the Aston by-election quit his Accounting course at TAFE, and SG a contact previously not contactable until two days before the Cadre School, joined dropping his University program at RMIT.
	
	But with the three extra people, no squish was really felt as CC, DM, RM, KI and WL had all headed to the USA for November. </tw-passagedata><tw-passagedata pid="76" name=":What LYM do" tags="Quote" position="6300,6700" size="100,100">The cadre school, held at a Virginia state park, was a taxing series of lectures and discussions that “scared you to death” about the state of the world, says Winstead, now 28.

	t&#39;s a political movement that a lot of people would describe as a cult because the leader, Lyndon LaRouche has complete and unquestioned control over all of their policy and operational choices. He thinks the British Empire is behind basically all the evil in the world, and that Obama is a Hitler-like figure, along with a lot of other crazy shit.
	
	Positively, I&#39;ve been exposed to a lot of stuff most kids my age haven&#39;t, such as classical music (I play violin and viola), Shakespeare, philosophy by Plato, etc. The movement is very interested in intellectual pursuits, &quot;expanding your mind&quot; and stuff like that. Instead of watch TV or listen to pop music, I listened to and played classical music and read books I could barely understand. I acted in King Lear when I was very young and know a lot of it by heart still.
	
	Negatively, my family is very poor and my upbringing has made me weird in a lot of ways it&#39;s hard to explain to anyone because they didn&#39;t grow up in a political cult. I can&#39;t relate with kids my age on a lot of things. I watched Nickelodeon and Cartoon Network sometimes at friends&#39; houses, but that&#39;s about it. Also, I suck really bad at video games because the movement (and therefore my parents) considered them evil and I rarely played as a kid. Harry Potter, most movies, all pop music (and jazz or blues), all evil and meant to dumb down the population, according to LaRouche.
	
	I tell most of my close friends and they&#39;re very interested when I tell them usually. They don&#39;t really give me negative shit for it.
	
	&quot;Participating&quot; entailed sitting in their office every day, attending their meetings and listening to webcasts by Lyndon LaRouche (he still gives them sometimes). Also going out on the street wearing signs and passing out our literature, talking to grown adults when I was 7+, telling them why Dick Cheney, Al Gore, John McCain, Joe Lieberman, etc. were evil puppets of the Queen of England. I didn&#39;t really know much about US Politics outside of the lens of the movement, obviously, since I was a kid.
	
	If I were head of this cult/organization, I&#39;d let the very smart and well-meaning people within it realize that they could have their own ideas and that their input was as valuable as mine. The movement is filled with people who really honestly do want to see the world a better, smarter, more intellectual and scientific-minded place, and I agree with them about all that. So I&#39;d like to get them to gear these passions in a useful, non-crazy direction.

	Larouchieama, thank you for posting. I recently went through a debunking process for myself from LaRouche. I agree with that that the organization has drawn to itself some very intelligent and dedicated people. Several years ago, I was searching around the internet to try to figure out what the heck was going on with the world and came across the LaRouche movement. In 2003, his commentary on Bush and Cheney seemed right on. And the organization was building what was to be the LaRouche Youth Movement.
	
	The US was in Iraq and the torture pictures has just come out from Abu Graeb (sp?). For me, as a previously apolitical person, it was great to see someone calling for the impeachment of Cheney as a puppet of whatever evil forces there were. LaRouche called it the oligarchy. I called in and was put in touch with someone with whom I became friends, even hosted a couple of the LaRouche Youth in my home. Then lost interested in their program. A couple of years ago, I was again distressed about what was going on and looked up LaRouche again. This time, I was very impressed with the caliber of the young people and the news and science they presented. (Yes, I now know it wasn&#39;t really, hard science and it was used to back up LaRouche&#39;s crazy ideas, but the young people were sincere and some of the information was solid and accurate.)
	
	Again, I hosted a few of the LaRouche Youth in my home, they were out promoting NAWAPA. I would describe them as sincere, concerned about the welfare of the nation, intelligent and wholesome. I would watch the video presentations on LaRouchePac. Sure, they were over the top with the Hitler mustache on Obama, but when one listens to their reasons, they seemed to back it up with what seemed at least plausible. The independent payment advisory board (IPAB) does have the authority to, with the stroke of a pen, determine which class of procedures can be denied, thus taking the power of medical decisions out of the hands of doctors and patients and their families. (Although this is what insurance companies and HMO&#39;s do and have been doing all along.) Obama did sign the NDAA (of course it had been approved by Congress) that allows for indefinite detention of US citizens without out trial, he is overseeing and expanding the drone strike program further enabling warfare to be surgically clean and not even be called warfare, etc, etc.
	
	The crazy thing about the LaRouche organization is that there seem to be sincere people in there, who somehow end up explaining LaRouche&#39;s paranoid world view with enough subsance to make it plausible. And there are plenty of crazy things to be explained even if it were not from LaRouche.
	
	Several months ago, I noticed that one of the LaRouche youth who had been at the forefront of the LaRouche Youth Movement (LYM), stopped being on the videos and wondered why. So occasionally I would search the internet for a clue. For LaRouche curious folks, Why We Left (WWL) by Sky Shields, et al is an indepth view into the paranoid world of Lyndon LaRouche. That document sent me back to the debunking process (I had done it once before, but somehow it didn&#39;t completely stick.) It is a strange organization that gives simple answers to complex problems. Glass-Steagall to fix our financial problems, NAWAPA, North American Water and Power Alliance, a grand scheme to bring fresh water down from Alaska, to put people back to work at scientifically and technologically advanced work. You know, build ourselvers out of the financial mess. Simple. If only the rest of the world would just listen, perhaps is they (the Larouchies) say it often enough and the world with listen, the problems with the economy and the world will be fixed.
	
	And yet, while I now completely agree that Lyndon LaRouche is bat shit crazy, I can also understand your situation. I consider myself reasonably intelligent, I never cared much for politics and was rather forcefully awakened to them by the current state of affairs in our country and our world. For a novice in the political world, LaRouche&#39;s explanations seemed to make as much sense as the pundits on the Left and on the Right that are always going after each other without getting to solutions. Ya gotta admit there is a lovely grandeur to the NAWAPA project, unfeasible as it is in today&#39;s political climate.
	
	My best to you, I would suggest that you, without ever mentioning it to your well meaning parents, attempt to get in contact with some of the young people that have left. Let the sorting out process begin. &lt;&lt;&lt;

	MY STORY
	
	My involvement in the Larouche  Movement was at quite a low level, and it&#39;s not really &quot;bad&quot; per se.  I am grateful for having had this experience.  I am now much more aware of crucial matters than most people I encounter (mathematics, economics, arts, history) due to my involvement.  So my experience was more positive than negative.  (Without my Larouche experience, I probably wouldn&#39;t have followed your writing Henry.)
	 
	I left mostly because I wanted to go back to a normal life and to have a family (which is rather impossible when living in that movement).
	 
	But my experience was good because EVERYDAY, we would be practicing our voice to sing in &quot;Bel Canto&quot; method (the method of the Renaissance). We would read Classics in groups, either be Socrates&#39; Republic, Friedrich Schiller&#39;s plays, the Fundamental theorem of Algebra from Carl Freidrich Gauss or the Habilitation Dissertation from Bernard Riemann, or Gottfreid Leibniz&#39;s Monadology, calculus or metaphysics.  Constitutional papers was also read like the Federalist papers and so on.  Geometrical papers were also read and practiced.
	 
	The Larouche movement was my university.  We were briefed every morning (morning briefings) on how the political landscape was evolving and what would be our position, and how to be efficient.  This helped our organizing in the streets. I thought we would change the world for the better.
	 
	But at some point.. I had used up all my savings and wanted to get back to a normal life.  I still attended some classes, read Lyn&#39;s papers, organized from time to time.
	 
	kronberg-suicide.jpg(left. Kronberg committed suicide by jumping off a busy freeway bridge)
	
	KEN KRONBERG&#39;S DEATH
	
	But when Kenneth Kronberg died in 2007 and I saw the briefings following his death, I realized how lucky I was not to be forced to follow the narrative. There  was no compassion for Ken and gratitude for his lifelong contribution.  The youth group had to rationalize Ken&#39;s death in terms of Lyn&#39;s contempt against Baby Boomers.  The gist was that Baby Boomers had no idea how to create wealth (or that they only know how to consume, instead of producing).  
	 
	There was a untenable paradox in the air:  How could the youth think they could be saved when a lifelong contribution to the movement couldn&#39;t spare him from Lyn&#39;s contempt?    So what could spare you?  This is where the cult thing comes up.  I guess you have to follow everything Lyn&#39;s says.  Even if you have to crumble under major debt ON BEHALF OF HIM doesn&#39;t mean you&#39;ll get his respect.  Just thinking about this makes me puke.
	 
	Lyn created a tension between the youth and the Baby Boomers.  The Baby Boomers had to work hard trying to get donations (in telephone boiler rooms) while the youth were outside on the streets trying to persuade people and sell books. But Lyn kept the tension that the youth were doing &quot;right&quot;  by singing in the street, while Baby Boomers were &quot;wrong&quot; because they could never grasp the idea of being productive.

	&quot;Culture of Death!&quot; no -
	
	&quot;&quot;&quot;
	Australian youth have inherited a dying culture, which was engineered toward that end. We all believe on some level or another, that this is a culture of no future, a culture that cannot continue.
	&quot;&quot;&quot;
	
	Now, look at some of the other
	hallmarks of the devastation of our
	generation:
	* 6% of year 11 and 12 students
	commit acts of self harm. (Austral-
	ian 2/8/05)
	* One in every three young peo-
	ple admitted to the adolescent med-
	ical unit at the Royal Children’s
	Hospital Melbourne are mental
	health related (Sunday Age 26/06/
	05), while one in five of all young
	Australians have mental health
	problems. (The Age 22/7/05).
	* 15% of deaths among Austral-
	ian youth between 1993 and 2002,
	a staggering 2643, can be attribut-
	ed to the consumption of alcohol
	(Canberra Times 13/11/04), and one
	teenager a week dies from alcohol-
	related causes (The Age 29/12/04).
	* Half of Victorian 19-20 year
	olds are depressed, anxious, binge
	drink and partake in illegal behav-
	ior according to the latest Austral-
	ian Institute of Family Studies re-
	port.
	Ask yourself how much of this
	suffering and misery and death
	could have been prevented?

	=============
	“Many of the younger members were asked to leave school. Most members have no other source of income other than what is parceled out from fundraising. In some cases, no stipend is given and the member is totally dependent upon the structure of the organization to provide necessities, including food. Daily routine is strictly scheduled beginning with a morning briefing. Most of time spent is in long hours of fundraising on the streets and follow-up phone calls as well as organizing for meetings. Members also engage in “intellectual” activities that encourage the member to reinforce the philosophical doctrine of LaRouche, including reading Larouche’s own writings promptly. The average work day is at least 12-13 hours. Association with family or former friends is highly discouraged and members are made to feel guilty about spending holidays with family. Outside leisure activities are discouraged.”
	
	Information Control
	===============
	“A daily briefing is produced every day detailing the news events and the particular interpretation of the global strategic situation by LaRouche. The lead of the briefing is supposed to contain the latest message that the group organizes around. At least 2 weekly meetings are held for the leadership where LaRouche gives his speech to the rest of the members which is to be repeated and incorporated in to the next day’s briefing. In addition LaRouche also does this on shows put on the website. According to LaRouche, the global situation is always dominated by the competition between Larouche and his enemies, the British Empire. Members at the headquarters on Purcellville, VA are expected to make several videos a day with this information. Often times the particular spin put on news is supposed to be insider knowlegde given to LaRouche by contacts and therefore cannot be questioned or traced. Field organizers are usually kept so busy so that they could not research it anyway. Spying is definitely encouraged among members. Any demoralization is looked at as a threat and demands an intervention. The fear that there may be an enemy operation run on a member by outsiders or family is exploited when someone expresses doubt. When the doubt is not subject to control, LaRouche will explicitly lie about the person to divert attention.”
	
	Thought Control
	============
	“Members are pushed to their physical and psychological limit by the thought that the global economy can disintegrate at any moment or that the British will launch thermonuclear war. This is the reason given for why people cannot leave or do anything other than what is prescribed to them by LaRouche. LaRouche will usually give time frames for when a policy must be passed in order to avert the immediate crisis.”
	Emotional Control
	
	“LaRouche uses emotional manipulation regularly. He can never be wrong. When he changes his story it is always the fault of the membership. Any problem that is raised is always blamed on the membership, specifically the older membership of baby boomers. LaRouche blames the entire generation of baby boomers for all the problems in the world since the death of Franklin Roosevelt. He belittles them as a whole and will use specific people as examples of cowardice. This type of belittlement may have been influential in the suicide of one of the long term members. Anyone not with the views of LaRouche is said to be immoral and less than human. Anyone that leaves the organization is considered spiritually dead and is seen to be forfeiting their human claim to immortality.”
	</tw-passagedata><tw-passagedata pid="80" name=":LaRouche - No future generation" tags="Quote" position="6175,6575" size="100,100">Once again, the fear of Lyn [Lyndon LaRouche] and his ideas has the oligarchy quaking in their seats. They are terrified. And I think they are consulting with those little green men beneath the floorboards that Lyn refers to. And the biggest question ringing in their ears is: How does Lyndon LaRouche get all of these young people? Why can&#39;t we recruit the youth? Where did they come from?
	
	Unfortunately, where we came from is why they are not recruiting us. Now, &quot;What&#39;s wrong with where we came from?&quot; some of you might ask. We are the Baby Boomers&#39; kids, &quot;Generation X,&quot; the &quot;lost generation&quot; or, as we all know, the &quot;no-future generation.&quot; Any way you say it, it is not very uplifting. I am sure when our parents were young, they did not envision this as their legacy, but when they were challenged, they did very little in the face of corruption. Now LaRouche says that we have the potential to become the new Renaissance generation. And we were never told by anybody but Lyn, that we should do something good for humanity, that humanity needs us, and that we would be a part of humanity forever. What we were told instead was never to stand out: &quot;Be part of the crowd!&quot;...

	</tw-passagedata><tw-passagedata pid="81" name=":History of Lyn" tags="Quote" position="6175,7325" size="100,100">In 1971, his followers even managed to set up a debate between LaRouche (who would soon be advertising himself as the greatest economist on the planet) and the great post-Keynesian economist Abba Lerner.
	 
	Around 1973, however, this changed, as LaRouche launched “Operation Mop-Up,” essentially a declaration of war on the rest of the Left. Focused initially on the rump Communist Party, which he accused of being an FBI front, LaRouche’s backers were soon engaged in physical combat with leftists.
	Around this same time, LaRouche’s group was becoming a bona fide cult. Long fascinated by psychoanalysis, LaRouche began employing techniques of “ego-stripping” and psychological manipulation to his own followers.
	
	&quot;&quot;&quot;
	Impotence! Fear of rats! CIA-rats, KGB-rats, FBI-rats, trade-union-official-rats, Left-rats generally. Rats! Rats! Rats! Save yourself! Be impotent! The rats hate anything which is not impotent! There are so many rats! Gigantic, awfully monstrous beetles, malevolent beetles with beetle eyes and gigantic sexual organs are coming to rape us. . . . Find a woman to be a surrogate for your mother, and propitiate the awful gigantic rat of a mother-image sadist within you with another woman. . . . You feel better at the same time you feel the awfulness of that degradation. Mother always loved you again after you were punished. . . . Live a private life of Hell, keep your frightened Self cowering within the rat-mask you wear for the edification of the world of rats. Be impotent; be a “Trotskyist.”
	&quot;&quot;&quot;
	
	At the same time, LaRouche’s own literary output began to assume a particular style of classically informed (Plato, Liebniz, and Schiller being particular touchstones) long-winded psychosis. A good example is the twenty-six-thousand-word treatise “The Sexual Impotence of the Puerto Rican Socialist Party,” which covers everything from Hegel and “the agony of self-consciousness” to LaRouche’s racist ramblings on Latin American “macho” culture. From here on out, this kind of prose would remain LaRouche’s métier.
	
	LaRouche had long been concerned with the effects of music on psychology, writing in 1980 that “Rock was not an accidental thing. This was done by people who set out in a deliberate way to subvert the United States. It was done by British intelligence,” and that the Beatles were “a product shaped according to British Psychological Warfare Division specifications.” The brainwashing of John, Paul, and company could be resisted, however, through proper tuning.  (LaRouche and his followers favored A4 tuned to 432 Hz).

So why are we in this mess today? And this was quite a shock, and I decided to work more on this. I mean, it is just ridiculous. We have to get out of this and create a new Renaissance.

	What is wealth? What is true wealth? Is it just money on an account, or is it having gold and diamonds somewhere in your palace, is it raw materials, maybe military power? Friedrich List said: That is not true, none of them is true wealth. And he said: True wealth is our ability to produce, to produce wealth. That is the true wealth, to be able to produce it.
	
	...
	And what really struck me in this book The National System of Political Economy was that he said: Look, maybe in the future we could figure out a way to produce heat without using one of the known materials to make fire with. So we could say he hypothesized nuclear energy. He did not know anything about it, but he said: Look, maybe we will find something else, we will find something new. This is just great!
	
	Who talks like that today? Who talks about production and investment in the future and having science-driver projects? It is Lyndon LaRouche and his movement. Here we find optimism and people who say: Look, let&#39;s produce, let&#39;s get things done, let&#39;s develop...

	I really have to be honest here, what is up here is not the youth per se, it is not about us—it is about LaRouche, and if you think about it, it is really about you. The policymakers are in need of your help. Before I start my presentation, I want to personally thank Mr. LaRouche and let him and the youth in this room know, that LaRouche&#39;s Presidential campaign doesn&#39;t tap-dance.

	By 2003, recruitment was successful enough to receive LaRouche&#39;s own enthusiastic approval.&quot;Give me 1,000 youth leaders like these,&quot; he announced that year, &quot;and I&#39;ll take over the country.&quot;
	
	That goal may have been a little optimistic. The figure of 1,000 new members has not been mentioned in a while. But the movement&#39;s Web site now lists contact information for 21 cities. 
	
	---
	When they are not busy studying geometry or learning to sing properly, youth organizers are expected to meet a daily fund-raising quota. In an open letter to the father of a Youth Movement member, a former long-time supporter of the LaRouche organization described the life of a full-timer organizer as &quot;dreary.&quot;
	
	But one might never know that from LaRouche&#39;s speeches to the movement, which often end, &quot;Have fun!&quot;

	Members &quot;spent countless hours reading and studying,&quot; she wrote, &quot;getting a better education in Western philosophy and politics than we had gotten [in college]. But that benefit was far outweighed by the brutalized and controlled nature of our day-to-day lives. Even as we were verbally flogged each day to use creative thinking to achieve &#39;humanistic relevance&#39; in the world, the reality was that we and our comrades used most of our time in dehumanizing and mind-deadening activity.&quot;

	Members are recruited in part around the claim that the movement will give them a real education in classical culture, with a particular emphasis on mastering Plato and Leibnitz.

They also managed three &quot;flag ship&quot; campaigns in the Melbourne Region, including the campaign Aaron Isherwood himself a member of the ALYM standing against Michael Danby in the seat of Melbourne Ports.

There, with a small staff of my campaign around me, and with something more than a hundred singing LYM, we changed the course history during the past week. The crucial action was not propaganda as such, but the combination of what I did personally, with support of a handful of close collaborators, as done in the context of an environment in which convention-goers avowed that we had deployed a thousand or more youth, where scarcely more than a hundred had been on premises. Our impact was tenfold more than could have been achieved with a thousand of your typical political groups. This actually shaped the setting of Senator Kerry&#39;s acceptance address, if not the address itself, and also shaped the emerging view of our efforts, as that view was expressed by leading figures at the close of the proceedings. The deployment of our U.S.A. youth movement, co-deployed in close coordination with me, will now be a major factor in shaping what happens to politics in the U.S.A. during the coming ninety days. The higher intellectual level of our youth deployment, is of crucial importance in the success so far, and the greater successes soon to come.
	
	The most important problem in the LYM&#39;s work does come from the pressures exerted upon the LYM by the older generations of &quot;Baby Boomers and Tweeners. This is an acute difficulty to be overcome in most of Central Europe, and an endemic problem against which I have had to fight in the U.S.A.
	
	The problem is, that those who have settled into regarding the Baby Boomer generation as the yardstick of political and intellectual competence are not only wrong; they fail to grasp the reality, that the Boomers, even most of our own internationally, do not realize how deep the corruption is which has been caused by the accelerating cultural decadence through globally extended European culture during, especially, the course of the recent four decades, as, for the British Commonwealth since the already disastrous, first Harold Wilson government of Britain.
	
	Thus, I have fought, not always successfully, for the functional independence of the youth movement as my personal movement, not necessarily under the control of the Boomers and Tweenies. The point is, that the characteristic of a healthy youth ferment is rooted in a more or less clear understanding, that the Boomers are committed to habits which define the present global situation as on an accelerating slide into a new dark age. The healthy fraction of the adult youth is defined by the recognition that the present cultural trend, as set by the Baby Boomers, is into the mucky swamps of a no-future society planet-wide; those young adults who see this reality, are thus faced with the prospect of living the next fifty years or so of their lives, if that long, in a no- future society. While their parents&#39; generation says &quot;Sit back and shut up!&quot; the alert young adult plunges into changing things, away from Baby Boomer culture, into something embodying the best taken from a happier, healthier time, forty years or so ago.
	
	However, once that is said and agreed, the task of the youth is to become qualified, especially in sufficiently deep grasp pf modern history, science, and poetry, to become the emerging new leadership of society during the emerging decade or so ahead. This means, above all, a mastery of the &quot;secrets&quot; of the mind. To win, one must become a professional winner, in the best sense of those terms.</tw-passagedata><tw-passagedata pid="86" name=":2004 election results" tags="" position="3900,1625" size="100,100">Name - ballot position					   votes electorate

	You had slept on a lumpy couch for a few weeks, until someone stole the $50 you had stashed next to your passport. A further $20 was stollen from your organising bag, ans so you changed houses.
	
	The new house felt even worse, you slept on the floor in a walk in wardrobe. Soon you got sick, and it took two days for someone to take you to the hospital.
	
	After all that you felt like you were going well. You were going to give your own class, and stayed back when half the office headed down early to the National Conference in California.
	
	But just before your class you were told you wouldn&#39;t be giving your class. That hurt a lot, and you couldn&#39;t figure out what had happened, or why they felt you were not good enough.

The group recruiting him had steered him through a sequence of key psychological experiences were established so he believed - insulated the group from criticism.

Use your own cognitive dissonance 
- that negative drive when you have two opposing ideas/beliefs/memories where the opposition causes a discomfort that motivates us to reduce the conflict.

adjust beliefs
deny beliefs (or the facts)
select confirmation (our belief is true, cherry pick info, ignoring what is against our belief)
repackaging - believing our experience doesn&#39;t have any weight, that our experience is a lie. -a no win situation.

avoiding info or situations that cause further dissonance.

https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IaUhR-tRkHY

we want to believe our investment isn&#39;t wasted.
So we repackage useless enterprise as having worth...
making the worthless group appear worthwhile.

Behavior - Emotion - Thought
pull hard enough  on one, and for consistency the other 2 will follow.
If our behavior is committed, our thoughts and emotions also become committed!

twisting concepts into their opposites just to preserve the idea.

admitting the group is wrong draws in trust, loyalty and credibility.
self image (what you did wrong based on that belief)

draw tentitive connections with results to their self-image
- you don&#39;t need a degree! change the world with us...

select confirming information to support the groups view...
then get into a commitment cycle - more time spent with group, less you question it critically.

plus the group turning on you -removing safety and security.

That safety and security - like the maelstrom!
letting go of the security of the floating objects so you can get free of the vortex.

In the youth can insert unsubstantiated concepts without resistance from the network.
then that injected concept becomes a core belief as others form linking to it
that core belief sticks to your identity.

To get the idea into older people they infantise people.
enforce them to change their wrong ideas (not confront/challenge LaRouche).

told about critics spreading lies - insulated / innoculated against opposing views (denying)
feel an illusion of being better - not because of narcasism but because of avoiding disonance.
regressing in understanding of the world, as it maps to the group think.

manipulation to put critics in NO-WIN SITUATIONS
tell them counter-arguments aren&#39;t scientific, that the devil power is used by opposers - so opposition is anti-scientific or demonic.
&quot;ready made realisations&quot;
You can&#39;t understand it because you are - a dummy, and want things you can understand like the Dummy Guides.

repackaging punishment for tax fraud as persecution
or protest for handling of suicide as persecution
so you don&#39;t critically think about it.

They Didn&#39;t Smell Cheney&#39;s Breath!
by Lyndon H. LaRouche, Jr.

February 16, 2006

Did it occur to you, that almost everything which Vice-President Cheney said about the events of the past weekend, was almost a complete lie? 
...It is not merely that he lies; lies fall from his lips like a species of feces from the flipping tail of a hippopotamus. This behavioral pattern of his is, specifically, clinically psychopathic. Without rhyme or reason, he just lies and lies and lies and lies. It is as if feces were his species!...

since no later than March of this year, the present world monetary-financial system has been gripped by an onrushing plunge into a form of crisis which is qualitatively worse than any crisis such as that of the 1928-1933 interval, a crisis much similar, on principle, to what Boccaccio saw, looking across the Arno, into the plague on the streets of Florence.

Preface: Science vs. Sophistry

All around me, my generation is dying out rapidly, and with its passing, go most among the best minds of physical science from the earlier experience of my adult lifetime. So, we have lost most representatives of that generation of thinkers whose achievements are typified by my associates of the Fusion Energy Foundation (FEF) of the 1970s and 1980s.

Competent approaches to science, such as the dynamics of the ancient Pythagoreans and Plato, best express those characteristics of human behavior which distinguish the human species absolutely from the characteristic activity of all lower forms of life.

importance of anchoring evidence - in valid sound logic
be comfortable not knowing - saying &quot;i don&#39;t know&quot; -avoid false realisations

 The sociopath Cheney has been widely feared as a thug and a killer. His present legal troubles are the result of a revolt by U.S. governmental institutions, which was itself organised through a relentless campaign by U.S. statesman and economist Lyndon H. LaRouche, Jr. LaRouche unleashed his drive to oust Cheney well before the Iraq war, in a September 20, 2002 statement, &quot;Iraq is a Fuse, But Cheney Built the Bomb&quot;. Over the next several years the LaRouche movement circulated tens of millions of flyers, pamphlets and books exposing the actually-fascist roots of the &quot;neoconservative&quot; cabal headed by Cheney, until institutional forces in the U.S. finally summoned the courage to join the battle.

The fall of Cheney will unleash political earthquakes worldwide. Liberal Imperialist British PM Tony Blair, Cheney&#39;s co-conspirator for the Iraq war, will go, and the Blair/Cheney-allied Howard/ Beazley pro-globalisation mafia which has dominated Australian politics since bankers&#39; puppets Hawke and Keating came to power in 1983, will be on the way out, as well...

September 2005

This New Citizen Extra is a wake-up call to you, the youth of Australia! The world is facing a very bleak future, even more so since the Bush/Cheney Administration utterly failed to deal with the Hurricane Katrina catastrophe, which means the world&#39;s supposedly most-powerful nation doesn&#39;t function, and doesn&#39;t even care about its own citizens....

...
 Presently, there is a culture of death among young Australians, which was purposely created to desensitise and even terrify us. This culture is typified by rock music and video games, which were cooked up in British Intelligence&#39;s psychological warfare bureau, the Tavistock Institute, along with its U.S. spinoffs, in order to brainwash youth. These video games have created mass killers as seen at Columbine, Littleton and elsewhere, as well as zombifying anyone who plays them. Our generation was produced by our brainwashed parents&#39; generation, the Baby Boomers, who were laboratory rats in the great social engineering experiment of Tavistock and the Congress for Cultural Freedom, which was unleashed beginning with the 1960s rock/drugs/sex counter-culture. This degenerate culture now rules the world. In its guise as empiricism, it is also the garbage drummed into you at uni.

The antidote to this garbage is a Classical education based upon the idea that truth is knowable and can be discovered, in both science and art, which is the basis for the curriculum which the LaRouche Youth Movement (LYM) is studying internationally. The great German poet and dramatist, Friedrich Schiller, for instance, and Johann Sebastian Bach, with his Jesu, meine Freude motet, exemplify some of the best of Classical culture. Australia once had the beginnings of such culture too, which must be revived and enriched using the best of the world&#39;s Classical culture, as Australians have done in the past.

August 2005

&quot;Cheney&#39;s Guns of August&quot;
On July 27, American statesman and economist Lyndon H. LaRouche, Jr. issued a dramatic warning that U.S. Vice President Dick Cheney intended to launch an unprovoked nuclear war against Iran during the month of August, under cover of a staged &quot;new 911&quot; against the U.S. Within 24 hours, the LaRouche Youth Movement (LYM) had saturated Washington D.C. and the U.S. Congress with the warning. Within 48 hours, a correspondent for LaRouche&#39;s Executive Intelligence Review magazine had asked White House press spokesman Scott McClellan about

Cheney&#39;s plans against Iran.

...
The prospect of impeaching Cheney and Bush in order to stop their synarchist controllers drive for fascism and nuclear war has become a live issue in the U.S.

# On the eve of the Crash:
Defeat the Synarchy—
Fight for a National Bank #

In the 1930s Depression, some of Australia&#39;s leading corporations and families sponsored mass fascist armies against the attempts of the Labor governments of Scullin and NSW Premier Jack Lang, to put the interests of the Common Good above those of the financiers. In the early 1940s, those same financiers set up the Liberal Party.

Today, a new global depression looms, and the Big Business-controlled Liberal Party has passed more police state powers (with Labor&#39;s help) than Hitler himself had in early 1933, and for the same reason—not to &quot;fight terrorism&quot;, but to control the population.

The Night they came to kill me - Larouche March 2004

n October 6, 1986 a virtual
army of more than four
hundred armed personnel de-
scended upon the town of Lees-
burg, Virginia, for a raid on the
offices of EIR and its associates, and
also deployed for another, darker
mission. The premises at which I
was residing at that time were sur-
rounded by armed force, while air-
craft, armored vehicles and other
personnel waited for the order to
move in shooting. Fortunately, the
killing did not happen, because
someone with higher authority
than the Justice Department Crim-
inal Division head William Weld,
ordered the attack on me called off.
The forces readied to move in on
me, my wife, and a number of my
associates, were pulled back in the
morning.
That was the second fully docu-
mented case of a U.S. Justice De-
partment involvement in opera-
tions aimed at my personal elimi-
nation from politics...

I am a political organiser, trainee statesman and student in the LaRouche Youth Movement from Australia currently in Montreal, Canada.

Just today Bruce Director (who writes the Riemann for Anti-Dummies series) actually in a question about patriotism said &quot;Australia is not the centre of world politics, it is a corner, but at that a very important corner...&quot;; what I think hints at the point that the reason we are in North America is because of the fact that Australia&#39;s isolation was hindering the ability of the LYM in Australia becoming self perfecting, and so the odd dozen of us are cycling through the USA, spending three months in the USA and then at the moment 6 months in Canada (well one or two people got to do some time in Europe). We had a good conversation with Bruce on the reasons we are here in Canada, what was demoralising a lot of us organisers (not to mention the poor Canadians that we landed on). And he said we need to be calling him at least weekly (if not more often).

I am a weird sort of organiser in the LYM though I must admit, I joined just around my twentieth birthday in November 2003, after a trip to Sydney and Canberra to hit up a George Bush Visit. Then when I joined most of the guys in the movement were in the West Coast of America for two months, meaning we had one or two organisers and a whole bunch of new people that really worked in raising the potential of the organisers (rather than entering a lull because everyone else is doing what you want to do). I like modern history, mathematics and seem to get away with far to little singing; and at the moment of a night (last night and tonight) I have been doing some pretty basic soccer drills late at night for some exercise.

So as most LYM organisers I have a tight schedule, but what I intend on doing is writing every night a &quot;nightly&quot; as you will, before going to bed. It is 2:10am (28June) right now and I need to be up by 7:00 to be in for French at 8:00am.

This is rubbish. We have no money, because the pay is so bad. That means we aren&#39;t eating properly.

Overworked, sleep deprived, malnourished.

Since your requests for more pay haven&#39;t been answered, you are resigning.

Request a flight this weekend before the cadre school.


tonight I am spending the first time in almost six months in a room by my self sleeping, it has a door and a mattress on the ground, my clothes are in the wardrobe, my towel hanging on a towel rack, and my books all stacked in a small desk (plus my food in a freezer shelf) and it is just me in the room with the door closed.
I had pretty much since moving to Montreal a room to myself without a door, with my bed under a desk in the entry room to the house we are in (meaning if someone used that door it awoke me), but now this is something different because two of the couples moved out of the house (thus now the lounge and a bedroom was made empty) so then Rachel and Lucas moved into their room (the bed in there was Rachel&#39;s) and so I got to move out of the entry (what also was loud and windy) into there room.

[[stressed running]]</tw-passagedata><tw-passagedata pid="287" name=":Noosphere" tags="" position="3950,425" size="100,100"> I will want to explain a bit on the human body. I never believed any of that crap that humans are physically less powerful than animals, because it was an un-real situation in which people forgot that they have a mind etc. And in real terms that mind is at times a little sloppy to be thinking that Humans are insuperior to animals, but anyhow I wanted to just briefly tonight go over the levels of powers in our universe.

At the basic level of our universe, I guess there are powers that attract bodies to each other in space (as in gravity) and cause simple chemical reactions (like the exchanging of electrons). What is termed generally &quot;The abiotic sphere&quot; or the &quot;unliving sphere&quot;. This is pretty simple, as in reactions take eons. Like a rock wearing away or something like that, but then again a rock wearing away (or weathering) actually is an action of a higher power, the power of life.

Life, or the &quot;biosphere&quot; was termed by Vernadsky to be that layer of the universe that interacts chemically at a greater level than chemicals themselves. And from that standpoint, you can think of things like oxygen, generated by life and it now makes up a sizable part of the air we breath, that Oxygen was generated by life, and actually the first life that generated it was killed by it (those little microbes that use to eat minerals naturally occurring, before photosythesis and other complex life functions were generated). But this also brings up the question of &quot;WHERE DOES LIFE COME FROM?&quot; what is one that people like Vernadsky and before him Pastuer who at one point almost went mad trying to generate life from nothing...

But above that level of the biosphere there is a third layer, the layer of human interaction. We do not understand the universe by some biotic process. Instead humans have a power to understand and apply physical principals more effectively than any other living being (known), and thus a sphere of humanity is formed known as the &quot;Noosphere&quot;, and the examples of things in this Noosphere is how minerals have been formed into Alluminium by the expense of energy not able to be focused by life. That we too can create cans of pure gases etc. And that we can change the way that the globe is going, save or destroy species (like viruses) as we apply ourselves.

I know this is getting long, but people are really needing to understand this from the standpoint of actually applying this real understanding of the Universe to government et al. to economics and to ordering the planet for the greatest potential. To be employing the greatest biodiversity, or power or well potential I think is the best name f:or it.

[[Anti-dummies]]</tw-passagedata><tw-passagedata pid="288" name=":Anti-dummies" tags="" position="3950,300" size="100,100">here is every Tuesday and Thursday I think a &quot;So You Wish to Lean about Economics&quot; marathon being run in LA, that here in Montréal we are patching into (watching live or watching the video of later), that at the start of the second part I saw (and the third in the serries, because I missed the second part) a question was asked that I have tried to answer for my first time bellow (I know it has a lot to be done still):

* * * * * * * * * * *
I figured that by self evident LaRouche was meaning that they are the
basis of geometry, now some modern Mathematicians like the a large
faction in the Australian Mathematicial Society actually have changed
terms in Mathematics like Triginometry to Cyclometrics (sort of like
how the posititive terminal in Canada is the cathode (and not the
anode) because of a change in structure) to try and simplify making
the point that it comes from circular action, but LaRouches claim is
not that they are an axiomatic basis. And by axiomatic basis I mean to
say that Geormetry is based on circular action because we choose to,
or because the greeks used a straight edge and compas, but that
circular action is the basis of geometry because implicity everything
can be broken down into circular action, sort of like how all
(positive) Intigers can be broken down into Prime Numbers.

sort of like how 12 can be broken down into 2*2*3 (and I will try and
draw the graph)
12
2 * 6
- 2 * 3
or 101 can only be broken down to 1 and 101, geometric shapes can be
broken down into actions derived from circular action as its basic
elements.

Like how drawing a trainagle can come from a cicle divided on its
circumferance by its radius (what divides six times, and is the way of
generating a hexagon) and using every second verticie formed, and
simularily for all the other regular geometric polygons (with some
complex solutions needed for the division of the circle, that
nonetheless require circular action anyhow). [I know this needs to be
cleared up]

[then maybe going into the idea of least actions role would be good to wrap it up with I think]

[[</tw-passagedata><tw-passagedata pid="289" name=":stressed running" tags="" position="4075,425" size="100,100">Well really, the only spare time I have is what I create (it is almost like stealing free time). So when I have spare time it is something like half an hour when I decide to go for a walk around the city I am in after having grabbed something to eat, or just in want of clearing my head a little.

I really wished I was able to get this running thing of the road, but last time I started I got up to doing something like five minutes for five laps of a soccer field on the second or third night of the scheme and then got sick not to want to push it since. I also two nights kicked a football home to kick it around a bit and get up my skills, but that too also came to a stop... but then again the idea with that was to have some fun and build up some skills by doing just some dribbling drills around some parks, the second night I did it it was at a smaller park so I felt a little weird compared to kicking it all the way home like I did the night before that.

But really I do not find to much time to relax, maybe just laying on my bed is all that I really want to think. Though I do guess that on the drives recently (while I was down in Ontario) I was doing a little bit of game design using inform 6, and occasionally I like to get onto Wikipedia and update an article or two; but both of these last two things take a lot of effort that I haven&#39;t really the time I wish I had for them.

Maybe this is why I get a little more stressed than the next guy at times.

[[phone work]]</tw-passagedata><tw-passagedata pid="290" name=":phone work" tags="" position="4075,550" size="100,100"> really detest phone work at moments like these where I have called almost everyone on my list, and spent an hour dialing and thus I feel I have wasted it all.

There is an element of rejection, or a feeling of it when you call for so long and have no conversations, sometimes it is made worse (that feeling) by having people around you getting only conversation after conversation. But then again, I guess sometimes I get that too, and that is when you just have to work hard to keep on the ball and keep the people understanding what you are talking about (as conversations sometimes merg and you tell something that relied on what you told another person...).

But even though I haven&#39;t had conversations, I can honestly say that I have cleaned out three or four cards of non-potent people who really don&#39;t need to be called in the future (no conversations were had with them, I just read the comments that were all gloomy and decided that since they lived so far away they need not be a waste of our time).

[[pizza]]</tw-passagedata><tw-passagedata pid="291" name=":pizza" tags="" position="4075,675" size="100,100">I just went and purchused some Pizza for lunch, and the guy a the shop asked me where I was from, I was pretty cool with that one. And then he explained he was from Lebanon, I was good with understanding that.

But then rather than talking about the war, he asked if there were a lot of Lebanese in Australia, as which because I didn&#39;t know that &quot;beaucoup&quot; was a lot, I did not understand him at all here and thus the conversation fell appart.

But now I know that beaucoup means a lot, giving more insight into why people say &quot;merci beaucoup&quot; (something I sometimes say to others but only knew it to mean thanks in a more polite way).

[[quitting]]
</tw-passagedata><tw-passagedata pid="292" name=":quitting" tags="" position="4075,800" size="100,100">Today I put in a letter of resignation to Melbourne. And then called them, Robby wasn&#39;t able to confirm any arrangements etc. being made. But he put down the task for me to tell all of my colleagues about my decision.

What was quite a task, I got all sorts of reactions. But most memorable of all, is the fact that Rachel believes that I will want to come back to work here because of the person I am. And Kel outlined that I may want to come back and I will think myself not potent enough to be able to come back and organise.
So from this present standpoint of standing on my decision to leave, and not let myself be guilt-ed or anything like that to keep working, I want to at least remember those two lines. The exact words are not that particular but the fact of what they are saying, is.

Rachel, Andy, Lucas and Glen had me stick around and read LaRouche&#39;s latest paper with them, and then asked some questions on how I would organise around it tomorrow. I answered that I would find it hard, as I was wanting to leave, and trying to organise people to join something I am leaving is not simply ironic, it is darn near impossible from a truthful standpoint.

Hopefully tomorrow I will have the details all outlined on when I will be flying etc. and that will be good. I do not know if I will be organising tomorrow, I may be forced to take the day off and lull around until I can call Melbourne et al, maybe I will use that time to pack my stuff and clean everything needing cleaning if it comes to that.

===
It was weird organising today, because I am trying to recruit people to a fight that I am going to leave.

I got a $20 donation selling an Earths Next 50years book, what I think was the most that anyone raised today in the table on rue St Catherine near Place-de-Arts. It was a really long discussion, and yet I stuck at it and got the guy to understand that we are offering solutions and that he needs to act from a higher standpoint to solve them.

Glen also asked me a question about how successful I feel I have been in organising for two and a half years. At which honestly I feel I haven&#39;t been that successful, everyone I have started to recruit has left and that sort of likes. &quot;I sort of feel that my time here is marking time,&quot; would be the best way to explain the sort of feelings I have to the actions I have had in the movement.

Also on that, I feel like I am in a salient at the moment, as even still now I have had no word from Melbourne. No reply email to say they got my email, nothing. Silence, or worse yet the promise of future correspondence, when I feel I need to be making arrangements now, rather than having a long protracted time here in Montreal doing really nothing. I will be calling Melbourne in just a few minutes after submitting this (just after checking gmail again).

==
I am beggining to get worried that I will not be able to organise a flight back to Australia. That the aim is to keep me here in Montreal or something, I don&#39;t think is the case, but the fact is that I haven&#39;t in the two days since sending my letter of resignation been able to talk with Craig about rearranging my flights.

Will it be another two days until I get to speak to him? And will that mean at the earliest I will be flying on Tuesday next week? Meaning I still have 7 days here in Montreal?
Actually I think that what I should simply do is just rearrange my flight myself, but then I fear the costs not been able to be got back from my work - so I will continue to play it safe, as it is a cost I cannot afford.

While there at the deployment table it started to rain, then rained heavier and heavier until the water was coming sideways are wetting our literature on a table some eight feet away from the edge of the cover we were under. People generally here looked like wet shags on a rock, some people had their pants so wet they were falling down (what hipsters do when wet), and it was very funny to watch. So I began asking people if we had the infrastructure to make the city undercover? (at the moment we are tackling the people who are looting the economy and removing our manufacturing capability, as seen in the GM/Delphi shutdowns).

Then just ten minutes latter the sky wasn&#39;t open, but people walking past were without a drop of water on them...

&quot;Yeah! It&#39;s been, what, five years?&quot; Jess approaches the table, her smile widening.

&quot;I think so,&quot; you reply, your awkwardness melting into genuine surprise and delight. &quot;What are you doing here in Montreal?&quot;

&quot;I&#39;m here to study my Masters. Just got off the bus, actually. It&#39;s a long story,&quot; Jess says, gesturing to her bags.

You glance across the footpath where Stuart is handing out leaflets to the crowd, signalling for him to come over.

</tw-passagedata><tw-passagedata pid="299" name=":Walk with Jess" tags="Escape" position="3175,5800" size="100,100">
&quot;Wow, that&#39;s amazing! Uh, do you need help with those?&quot; you offer, glancing at her heavy-looking duffle bag.

Jess sighs in relief. &quot;That would be amazing, thank you. It’s been a trek.&quot;

You step around the table, intending to grab her duffle bag, but before you can react, Jess moves in closer, arms extended. She wraps you in a warm hug, her big backpack pressing awkwardly between you. You find yourself hugging the backpack more than her.

&quot;Thanks, Austin. It&#39;s really good to see a familiar face,&quot; she says softly, her voice muffled by your shoulder.

You straighten up, the duffle bag momentarily forgotten at your feet. &quot;It&#39;s good to see you too, Jess.&quot;

Jess pulls back slightly, laughing. &quot;Are we supposed to do la bise now?&quot;

You chuckle, unsure. &quot;I have no idea. Let&#39;s skip it this time.&quot;

Jess grins, nodding. &quot;Fair enough.&quot;

&quot;So, where are you headed?&quot; you ask, reaching down to finally pick up her duffle bag.

&quot;I&#39;m catching the Metro from Berri UQAM a few stops to check into my student accommodation,&quot; Jess explains.

&quot;Great, I can help you with your bags through the Metro,&quot; you offer. Stuart signals that it is ok for you to leave, pointing to three other organisers just smoking around a tree a short distance away.

&quot;Thanks, Austin. That would be a huge help,&quot; she says, genuine gratitude in her eyes.

You talk more as you lead her into the library building and then down the stairs to the station area. It is busier here.

&quot;So you said you are studying your Masters? What in?&quot; You ask.
&quot;I&#39;m studying International Relations, I finished a Bachelor of Asian Studies with Honours last year, and want to continue working as an academic,&quot; Jess says, she is beaming.

You pause before the station gages, helping Jess to use the ticket machine to purchase a single ticket. Then continue down the next stairs to the platform.

&quot;Austin, what are you doing in Montreal?&quot; Jess asks.

&gt;
&gt; [[Tell her how you feel stuck]]
</tw-passagedata><tw-passagedata pid="300" name=":Tell her how you feel stuck" tags="Escape" position="3175,5925" size="100,100">As you wait with Jess for the next train, the hum of the Metro station buzzing around you, she turns to you with curious eyes. &quot;So, how did you end up in Montreal, Austin?&quot;

You take a breath, considering how much to share. &quot;Actually, I work for a political party in Australia. But to educate us, they sent us to America. I don&#39;t want to burden you with all the details, but it&#39;s been pretty rough. Since January, I&#39;ve been working, studying, traveling around North America... Seattle, Portland, Sacramento, LA, Montreal, Toronto, even drove all the way to Windsor, next to Detroit, stopping at cities along the way.&quot;

Jess raises an eyebrow, clearly intrigued. &quot;What sort of visa are you on for that?&quot;

&gt; [[Technically I&#39;m a tourist]]
</tw-passagedata><tw-passagedata pid="301" name=":Technically I&#39;m a tourist" tags="Escape" position="3175,6050" size="100,100">You shift a little uncomfortably, knowing how it might sound. &quot;Uh, just a tourist visa.&quot;

Her eyes widen slightly, and she lets out a low whistle. &quot;Wow, that&#39;s... risky. Aren&#39;t you worried about getting in trouble?&quot;

You shrug, trying to play it off. &quot;Yeah, a bit. But it&#39;s been manageable so far. I just have to be careful not to overstay my welcome in any one place.&quot;

Jess looks at you with a mix of admiration and concern. &quot;That sounds intense. I don&#39;t think I&#39;d have the guts to do that.&quot;

You laugh softly. &quot;It&#39;s been an adventure, that&#39;s for sure. But what about you? Masters in what?&quot;

&quot;Political Science,&quot; Jess says, her eyes lighting up. &quot;I wanted to dive deeper into the stuff we touched on in high school. Plus, Montreal seemed like the perfect place for it.&quot;

&quot;That&#39;s fantastic. Montreal is such a vibrant city. You&#39;ll love it here,&quot; you say, genuinely excited for her.

The train arrives, and you both step inside, finding a spot to stand among the crowd. As the train starts moving, you continue to chat, the conversation flowing easily between you.

&quot;So did you travel all the way from Australia alone?&quot; you ask, trying to keep the focus on her.

&quot;Yeah, spent three days in New York. Now I&#39;ve got to settle in this week before starting my courses? Maybe explore the city a bit. It&#39;d be nice to have someone to show me around,&quot; she says, giving you a hopeful look.

&quot;Um,&quot; you are unsure about much of the city, other than organising spots you have tried.

&quot;It&#39;s past 12. How about a place for a drink, I want to continue this conversation,&quot; Jess says.

&gt; [[Um, I don&#39;t know]]

</tw-passagedata><tw-passagedata pid="302" name=":Um, I don&#39;t know" tags="Escape" position="3175,6175" size="100,100">You rub the back of your neck, feeling a bit sheepish. &quot;Actually, I haven&#39;t really gone out for a drink since I got here. Or at all, really.&quot;

Jess&#39;s jaw drops. &quot;You&#39;re kidding, right? I&#39;ve heard the nightlife in Montreal in summer is wild. You have to get a drink with me after we drop my bags in my room. It&#39;s non-negotiable.&quot;

You chuckle, feeling a mix of embarrassment and anticipation. &quot;Alright, alright. I guess I can&#39;t say no to that. It&#39;ll be a new experience.&quot;

&quot;Great!&quot; she exclaims, her excitement contagious. &quot;I promise it&#39;ll be fun. And you deserve a break after all your travels and work.&quot;

The train pulls into the station, and you both navigating up to the street, then towards the student accommodation following Jess&#39;s printed instructions.

The lobby has couches that you sit on as she checks in, gets a load of papers and what you suspect are keys. She smiles at you signalling to follow.

&quot;Ok, I&#39;m just going to drop all this. Then have a quick shower, I&#39;ve just had a twelve hour bus ride from a saultry New York.&quot; Jess explains.

&quot;Should I wait here?&quot; you ask.

&quot;No, come up, there will be a TV you can watch, or setup if it isn&#39;t already,&quot; Jess jibes. You take hold of her duffle bag again and follow her to the lift.

...
You have negative thoughts as Jess steps into her shower.

&gt;&gt;[[ Feel bad for escaping]]

Jess steps out of the bathroom in a towel.

</tw-passagedata><tw-passagedata pid="304" name=": Feel bad for escaping" tags="Escape" position="3300,6300" size="100,100">You flick through the stations, not really interested in anything.
It has only been twenty minutes since you left Stuart at the table, but you feel bad for leaving.

Jess steps out of the shower, no longer in jeans and a t-shirt, she now has a skirt and tank top on.

&quot;The guy at checkin said there is an Irish bar a block away, my shout,&quot; Jess says picking up her wallet keys and sun glasses.

&gt;&gt; Say you don&#39;t want to...
&gt;&gt; </tw-passagedata><tw-passagedata pid="305" name=":Irish Pub" tags="Escape" position="3300,6425" size="100,100">The dim lighting and lively atmosphere of the Irish bar were a welcome change from the suffocating environment I&#39;d been immersed in. Jess led the way, weaving through the crowd until she found an empty booth near the back. I followed, feeling the weight of my exhaustion lifting just a little with each step.

&quot;First round&#39;s on me,&quot; Jess said with a grin, heading to the bar. I slid into the booth, trying to ignore the persistent ache in my muscles and the fog in my mind.

Jess returned with two pints of Guinness, setting one in front of me before taking a seat across the table. She raised her glass, and I managed a tired smile as I clinked mine against hers.

&quot;Cheers,&quot; she said, taking a sip. I did the same, savoring the bitter taste and the brief moment of normalcy.

&quot;So, how&#39;s the LaRouche movement treating you?&quot; Jess asked, her tone casual but her eyes full of concern.

I sighed, setting my glass down. &quot;It&#39;s... rough, Jess. Really rough. They don&#39;t pay us, you know? We work these insane hours, and then we&#39;re expected to read LaRouche&#39;s works and study until nearly midnight every night. It&#39;s like they never want us to rest.&quot;

Jess&#39;s expression darkened. &quot;That&#39;s not right, Austin. You look exhausted.&quot;

&quot;I am,&quot; I admitted. &quot;I&#39;m so tired of it all. And the worst part is, they keep talking about this economic collapse, but it&#39;s like the only collapse happening is within the movement itself. I don&#39;t know how much longer I can do this.&quot;

Jess leaned forward, her eyes steady on mine. &quot;How did you end up joining in the first place?&quot;

I shrugged, thinking back. &quot;It was easy, really. They made it seem like I was doing something important, something bigger than myself. It felt like I was making a difference.&quot;

&quot;And what do you think keeps you there now?&quot; she asked gently.

I paused, considering her question. &quot;I guess... I don&#39;t know. Maybe it&#39;s the routine, the fear of leaving and not knowing what to do next. They make it seem like the outside world is worse, that we need them to survive.&quot;

Jess nodded thoughtfully. &quot;It&#39;s interesting how they create that sense of dependency. But if you joined so easily, doesn&#39;t that mean you could leave just as easily?&quot;

The realization hit me like a ton of bricks. &quot;I... I guess I could. I mean, they can&#39;t force me to stay, right?&quot;

&quot;Exactly,&quot; Jess said, a small smile playing on her lips. &quot;If you wanted to leave, what steps would you need to take?&quot;

I took a deep breath, starting to see the path more clearly. &quot;I&#39;d need to quit, tell them I want to go home. They&#39;d have to organize flights for me, especially since I don&#39;t have any money of my own.&quot;

Jess nodded encouragingly. &quot;That sounds like a solid plan. You&#39;re not stuck, Austin. You have the power to make this decision.&quot;

I felt a spark of hope for the first time in weeks. &quot;You&#39;re right. I can do this.&quot;

Jess smiled, relief evident in her eyes. &quot;Cults are like that, you know. They make you feel trapped, but it&#39;s all an illusion.&quot;

I nodded, the truth of her words sinking in. &quot;Yeah, they do. But I&#39;m done with it. I&#39;m getting out.&quot;

As we sat there, the noise of the bar fading into the background, I realized that this was my decision. I wasn&#39;t being coerced or pushed. I was taking control of my own life, finally seeing the absurdity of what the LaRouche group had been telling me.

&quot;Thank you, Jess,&quot; I said, gratitude filling my voice.

&quot;You&#39;re welcome, Austin. I&#39;m here for you, no matter what,&quot; she replied.

And with that, we spent the rest of the evening mapping out my escape</tw-passagedata><tw-passagedata pid="306" name=":Untitled Passage 6" tags="" position="2375,5750" size="100,100">Talking to Bruce this afternoon as I was thinking about leaving Canada, 
he suggested that it is most likely due to being home sick, I have been away from contact with Australia for a long time and am not really knowing how long it will be until I will be back in Australia.

And then add to that the stress created by the economic situation (Internationally as well as personally) and you have a really stress full situation. So a suggestion made was to become a test for going across the border, staying a month in Boston or something and then moving about like that.

I sort of am growing to like this, but also I understand that the social sort of dynamic I am around here I will be eventually going to in Australia when we do eventually return.

===

I am a political organiser, trainee statesman and student in the LaRouche Youth Movement from Australia currently in Montreal, Canada.

Just today Bruce Director (who writes the Riemann for Anti-Dummies series) actually in a question about patriotism said &quot;Australia is not the centre of world politics, it is a corner, but at that a very important corner...&quot;; what I think hints at the point that the reason we are in North America is because of the fact that Australia&#39;s isolation was hindering the ability of the LYM in Australia becoming self perfecting, and so the odd dozen of us are cycling through the USA, spending three months in the USA and then at the moment 6 months in Canada (well one or two people got to do some time in Europe). We had a good conversation with Bruce on the reasons we are here in Canada, what was demoralising a lot of us organisers (not to mention the poor Canadians that we landed on). And he said we need to be calling him at least weekly (if not more often).

I am a weird sort of organiser in the LYM though I must admit, I joined just around my twentieth birthday in November 2003, after a trip to Sydney and Canberra to hit up a George Bush Visit. Then when I joined most of the guys in the movement were in the West Coast of America for two months, meaning we had one or two organisers and a whole bunch of new people that really worked in raising the potential of the organisers (rather than entering a lull because everyone else is doing what you want to do). I like modern history, mathematics and seem to get away with far to little singing; and at the moment of a night (last night and tonight) I have been doing some pretty basic soccer drills late at night for some exercise.

So as most LYM organisers I have a tight schedule, but what I intend on doing is writing every night a &quot;nightly&quot; as you will, before going to bed. It is 2:10am (28June) right now and I need to be up by 7:00 to be in for French at 8:00am.

It angers you hearing about Phil spending his time in LA going to the pool, and not organising or going to classes.

In Montreal Phil doesn&#39;t contibute to the food, that you are annoyed about, because he eats it - and thinks he is just eating Swyn&#39;s share.

the following is the story of the LaRouche Youth Movement in Australia, pretty much blow by blow. Up until roughly two years ago (December 2003)


Phase One: where the force sort of gets formed.
The “Youth Movement” was formed in Australia on some otherwise uneventful day in August 2002. When four young members of the Citizens Electoral Council were (as some will say) “thrown together”. The original four, consisted of CC who had been on the field team, JL who had been in admin, and DM and RM who had been in intel.

This orginal team was then complemented within a month with two Tasmanians, CP and SL. Then in November with another two members, being WL (the brother of SL) and KI (the son of the CEC&#39;s founder, and the middle child at that). The shift then started to change towards organising for the New South Wales State Elections in March 2003, where the Flagship Campaign for the CEC was to be Maitland.

In January the whole of the CEC including the youth movement went to Maitland, where they started to systematically doorknock the electorate and started to kick up a storm to try and get our candiate elected. The three month campaign was broken for the “Youth Movement” by a trip to the USA.

So after the campaign the crew then returned to Melbourne (minus CP, who had quit with the end of the campaign), where they started to hit the University Campuses to try and recruit more “Youth Movement” members.

Phase Two: where forces reaches eight again.
After basically a month of organising on campuses, where the force of seven set up tables and tried to get students interested in what is happening around them. It is sort of ironic, that their next member was neither a University Student, nor recruited during the semester. KR, was recruited for the first trip since Maitland, being a trip to Canberra in June 2003, to get out the new Children of Satan pamphlet.

The CEC office also put on a performance of Schiller&#39;s “Joan d&#39;Art” at the July Confrence 2003, in which all of the Youth Movement Members played roles: JL playing Joan d&#39;Art.


Phase Three: A Cadre School.
Then an idea hit the CEC, that after a year of organising on Universities that having a Student only conference (or a Cadre School) at a camp in Anglesea would be the way to boost their numbers above eight members. Many weeks of organising went into aranging for students to come, and then when the main International guests Leini Rubinstien arrived and whipped them into a phoning frenzy for the last week to aim at doubling the number of people attending. Also for the Cadre School BM from Philadelphia LYM local came down as well as Leni from the LA LaRouche campaign office.

The Cadre School was a huge success in recruiting people, DA a contact from the Maitland campaign finished his year at University then joined. AR a contact from the Aston by-election quit his Accounting course at TAFE, and SG a contact previously not contactable until two days before the Cadre School, joined dropping his University program at RMIT.

But with the three extra people, no squish was really felt as CC, DM, RM, KI and WL had all headed to the USA for November.

2004 Federal Election
ALYM campaign cars in procession election eve

During the 2004 Federal Election, the ALYM had 12 of its members run for the House of Represenatives in the Melbourne Region, and Senate. They also managed three &quot;flag ship&quot; campaigns in the Melbourne Region, including the campaign Aaron Isherwood himself a member of the ALYM standing against Michael Danby in the seat of Melbourne Ports.

They started campigning from April 2004, door knocking the electorates of Melbourne Ports, Maribyrnong and Calwell with the Election edition of the New Citizen, that went through the fight for a National Bank in Australian Politicts and the founding of the Australian Liberal Party in the 1930-40 period.

But also during this time aided campaigns in Western Australia and Queensland.


New Bretton Woods Campaign
LaRouche&#39;s renewed calls for the New Bretton Woods International Monetary System in late 2004, had the CEC formulate a National Petition that was read out on 20 June 2005 in the House of Represenatives.

The Back bone of this petition drive was the Australian LaRouche Youth Movement, that send squads into Adelaide, Canberra, Sydney and even breif visits to surrounding areas NewCastle, Geelong, Bendigo and Ballarat. And the Melbourne region, where they set up tables in comerical areas, distributed New Citizen papers and organised students through classes. To reach an average weekly petition signer rate of around 500-600 as a group.</tw-passagedata><tw-passagedata pid="312" name=":Intervention" tags="" position="3175,7475" size="100,100">Intervention

2004 after the election was finished, I felt lost and wrote to the leadership saying so.

There response was to pull me into a room, and try to get me to open up, say that I had a bad past or something. It was all attacks at me. I cried, and couldn&#39;t answer their questions.

I then asked for a break. Was told no. After about thirty minutes I then got up and left.
The chairman in the toilet, whilst I pissed for a solid minute told me I was weak.

Then I witnessed two other people getting interogated in similar ways.
Stories of not knowing if they were raped as children.

A story of a girls room smelling like piss, in which he answered she had been fucking another member (not present) and fingering herself like a horny possessed witch. Later thinking about it, I thought - hey a pissed bed, and sex smells different.

Two or three days after the intervention, the secretary said everyone thought I was more level headed, and nicer since the intervention. 


I went to the doctors to check some lumps on the day the chairman had an &quot;intervention&quot;, walking back into the room to see him teary eyed. I had asked the doctor that I thought I was getting anxiety. He suggested I join a sports group, spend time away from the party, I heard &quot;it was unhealthy to dedicate all your time to the party.&quot;

The chairman&#39;s kids played sport. Even Rhys who had been an organiser for two years longer than I&#39;d been a member.
But I also thought of how difficult it would be to find a group. I&#39;m rubbish at sport, and also I would need to find a group, then arrange to sneak away from the 24/7 work we did to participate.

I had started to talk to the Jehovah&#39;s Witness people that visited my place. The bible they gave me was tucked into my bag, though I hadn&#39;t read it.

Touch and goes - the 6 to get base training complete - after type rating - before line training.

(if MPL - will need 12 instead of the 6 shown).

## ATPL Theory exams ##
You must have also of passed the following 14 ATPL theoretical examinations with a pass mark of 75% or greater. The ATPL theory subjects consist of the following:

Air Law
Aircraft General Knowledge – Airframe/Systems/Powerplant
Aircraft General Knowledge – Instrumentation
Mass and Balance
Performance,
Flight Planning and Monitoring,
Human Performance,
Meteorology,
General Navigation,
Radio Navigation,
Operational Procedures,
Principles of Flight,
Visual Flight Rules (VFR) Communications.
Instrument Flight Rules (IFR) Communications. (Only required to hold an IR)
A number of airlines regularly stipulate their preference for candidates who achieved over an 85% average pass mark, so in reality, this is the minimum you should be aiming for.

## Instrument Rating ##
Fly an aircraft in conditions where you can’t see the ground, such as in or above cloud is referred to instrument meteorological conditions (IMC). In these conditions, you can’t fly the plane by looking out the window you have to fly through reference to the aircraft’s instruments without. This is called Instrument Flight Rules (IFR). In order to be qualified to operate IFR, you must first hold an Instrument Rating (IR). You can complete the instrument rating on either a single or multi engine aircraft, but to operate for an airline, you specifically need to hold a Multi Engine Instrument Rating (MEIR).

When training for the instrument rating, the instructor will place special screens up in the windshield of the aircraft, or the student will wear special goggles to ensure the student can’t see outside. The screens go up at about 400 feet above ground level and are removed when coming into land at about the same height. After take-off, the student must navigate only using the aircraft instruments and radio beacons on a predetermined routing. A typical route involves navigating to another airfield, making an instrument approach followed by carrying out a missed approach before navigating back to the departure aerodrome to land.

During this phase of training, much emphasis is placed on the student’s pilot in command capabilities, with a lot of training being conducted as Pilot in Command Under Supervision (PICUS). This basically means that whilst the instructor has the overall legal responsibility of the flight, the student is encouraged to act as the Pilot in Command (Captain).

In addition to the theoretical examinations required to pass hold a CPL, you must also pass the IFR Communications theoretical examination before obtaining your MEIR.

To obtain an IR you must have completed a minimum of 50 hours cross country flying under instrument flight rules (IFR) as pilot in command. When the candidate is deemed ready, he/she must complete a mock skills test (called a 170A) followed by an official skills test with an approved instrument rating examiner. The test requires you to fly a number of exercises with reference only to the aircraft instrumentation, including the routing as described as above.

## Multi-crew cooperation training ##
The MCC phase of your training is designed to help make the transition from single pilot operation to multi pilot operation. Just about all commercial aircraft are operated with a minimum of two flight crew, a Captain and a First Officer, and have to work together effectively to ensure the safety of the operation.

The MCC course is comprises of both theoretical training and practical simulator training. The simulator used is typically a widely operated commercial aircraft such as a Boeing 737 or Airbus 320.

The course places a large emphasis on non-technical Crew Resource Management (CRM) skills such as decision making, teamwork and communication. It is the first time you are introduced to multi-crew standard operating procedures (SOPs) in an airline environment. The course usually consists of around 20 simulator hours and is very intense.

Some training organisations also include a Jet Orientation Course (JOC) as part of the MCC course. This shorter course is used to help develop the manual flight and automation managed skills needed to operate a large commercial jet aircraft.

A type rating is the endorsement to operate a specific commercial aircraft. The type rating has traditionally been provided by an airline once offered a job with that airline, but it is now becoming more common for the candidate to pay for the type rating him/herself when offered a job, or on completion of the ATPL training to become more employable.

A type rating is required to operate a specific aircraft that meets any of these requirements:

Carries more than 9 passengers
Has a maximum take-off weight of more than 5,900 kilograms
Is a jet aircraft
To commence a type rating the candidate must have a valid instrument rating and have passed all 14 of the theoretical examinations.

One person can hold a maximum of two type ratings at any one time. There are some generic type ratings, for example a type rating on the Airbus A320 allows the holder to operate the A318, A319, A320 and A321. Similarly, completing a type rating on the Boeing 737 NG allows the holder to operate any of the B737 series, both classic and next generation (300-900).

## Base Training ##
After completing your type rating, you’re ready to fly the aircaft for the first time. You take an empty aircraft up, and complete around 6 takes offs and landings (“touch and go’s) with a training captain. If you manage to complete the take-offs and landings to a good standard, the next time you fly the jet will be with passengers on board on day one of your Line Training.

## Line Training ##
Line training is where you operate the aircraft as part of normal airline operations (i.e. with passengers onboard) but with a Captain who holds special training qualifications (termed a ‘Training Captain’) who is there to provide training, supervision and mentorship.

Line Training is the final phase of your flight training carried out to bring you up to “line standard”. Prior to this you will have only flown the aircraft once during your base training without passengers.

Line training typically takes between 30 to 80 sectors (flights) and you are signed off when you are deemed proficient with the airline SOPs, non-technical skills and aircraft handling. You are then released “to the line” where you will fly with normal Captains as part of standard crew. This is where the learning really starts, and you never stop throughout your entire career!

The multi crew license is more aimed at countries where they are struggling to get pilots. Read comments from QF recently say that they were not considering introducing such a scheme as their current system was sufficient and that they had many applicants that fit their criteria from Airlines/GA/Air Force/Cadets. Would also suggest that we don&#39;t have a pilot shortage in this country!

I think that this post also points out the current obsurdity of the Australian system. I too have stories of people coming from overseas with Jet time unable to even get an interview in this country becuase of 500 Multi rule. However to axe the multi rule and replace it with a zero to hero program will just produce people whose first solo is in a 737. I cannot see how that is the safest option when we have such an enourous depth of pilot experience in this country. For countries that don&#39;t have the depth that kind of license is thier only option.

Who is going to be able to afford a multi crew license in Australia?? It&#39;s
$30 000 JUST FOR AN ENDORSEMENT!!!!!!!! How much will an entire license of 200+ hours going to cost???

What does the MPL training process look like?
Theoretical preparation. Undoubtedly, every pilot dreams of passing to the practical preparation after the beginning of training right away. However, the theoretical part is an inevitable stage of training. In terms of theoretical preparation, the MPL course accumulates at least 750 hours of instruction to ATPL (A) level with the hours for the Type Rating a student is applying for.

Practical training. The flight phase of the MPL programme consists of 4 stages:

Phase 1: core flying skills (specific basic single-pilot training)
Phase 2: basics (introduction of multi-crew operations and instrument flight)
Phase 3: intermediate (application of multi-crew operations to a multi-engine turbine aeroplane certified as a high performance aeroplane)
Phase 4: advanced (Type Rating training within an airline environment)

So, in total, the MPL training scheme secures a student with the minimum of 240 hours of practical training and can maximally be extended up to 404 hours depending on the course duration and the airline needs.

Areas of the competence after training. If a student completes MPL training programme, they are expected to have an advanced level of skills needed to operate and interact as a co-pilot of a multi-pilot turbine powered aeroplane under visual and instrument conditions.

Commonly speaking, the students will have to be able to: apply human performance principles, including principles of threat and error management; perform aeroplane ground operations, take-off, climb, cruise, descent, approach, landing as well as after landing and aeroplane post-flight operations.

What makes the MPL programme exceptional?
In fact, MPL programme combines Ab Initio training, Type Rating training and training courses undergone at the airline company. Just like ATPL course, the MPL programme is also carried out in a close cooperation with an airline, although with a stronger commitment of a student to an airline. The programme is specifically tailored to the airline requirements and needs, keeping in mind the type of aircraft it operates. Thus, initially it was not allowed for a student to move from one operator to another during training. Meanwhile, the students were taking a risk when applying for this programme.

TOWARD A SECOND TREATY OF WESTPHALIA
The Coming Eurasian World
… the oncoming waves of a great storm of global breakdown crisis are striking on the gates of the governments of the world, and are already pounding the hoaxster&#39;s illusion of Bush&#39;s economic recovery to shreds. The terminal breakdown-crisis of the 1971-2004 world monetary system is thus now fully under way.

Asserts his truths about the historic context of Plato and the penelonesian wars
Mirroring the current bush follies 

…The great leader for a time of crisis is onewhose selection breaks the rules, those rotten rules which are the relevant expression of the relevant, essential corruption. For that reason, society has tolerated only a relatively few truly great leaders for more than a short time. For example, as in the case of President Charles de Gaulle of France&#39;s Fifth Republic after 1963, the way in which bad governments recur or are maintained, is that the relevant leading institutions of society kill or otherwise eliminate capable leaders,..

…So, with rare exceptions, the most significant, but usually poorly sensed forces of history, proceed in long waves, even very long waves. The improved art of statecraft which our world needs for the present, and for the times before us, must return, away from the ruinous accumulation of present-day habits…

    Organising in a mass way! - Felt they were the drive for defeating carbon tax.
    
Since getting back, question - &quot;Lyn taking on responsibility&quot; not fluffy,
Bullshit and lack of commitment - infighting in the group - needed sorting
process - become more commited (political and intellectual) forced comfort reasons, &quot;move to higher level or stay in their ways&quot;

Coped a bit of &quot;well its not working for us&quot; - started in 2003 October, recruiting Willy-Nilly.
Leni - wanted us to recruit. Rang everyone, to try recruit them... Didn&#39;t know what they were joining - 
It was a process, it didn&#39;t come easily.
Recruitng for the hell of recuiting - back in 2003/4 - had 20 at one point.

Needed to run around constantly getting people to do what is necessary - rather than in coming from an internal drive.
&quot;People have a great potential to do good, if they choose to take that responsibility onto themselves&quot; - but that is a scary thing to do - it means you can&#39;t sit back and justify your behavior. can&#39;t justify &quot;I can&#39;t do this, I can&#39;t do that, and here is why&quot;
But it is a messy process.

Down to 5 full time - 3 members before USA (1 new, 1 during USA).
Healthier - lack of emotional baggage
The whole process is finding... - national identity (when Al Gor got Academy award).

Lucas - problems from the back - strong in the period, resulting in moving out to own office.
Orientation - fighting the Greenies.
Make a solid commitment - 300 organisers, committed to be out on the street once a week - (that is only 40)
9 full time organisers - recruiting boomers from phone organisers...
Dynamic of unified recruitment - you can recruit in a way that suprises you,
meet new people - see a process, &quot;beat the door down on us to want to join&quot; - that changes the dynamic.

Well the message was to X from Y (they are a couple). I didn&#39;t read it. But he explained it.
In Montreal I was so tired from being up all night, that I got directions to the house, and somehow caught a train, then a bus and walked a few blocks to find the correct place.

This week organised in San Francisco and LA.
Monday the downtown area.
	I think we were on Market St, but no one would tell me when I asked. It was a long long day.
Tuesday Berkley in the morning, then First A.M.E. Zion Church for lunch.
Wednesday Berkley again, but all day this time. Then I got a ride to the LA office in Pasadena.
I don&#39;t know what time it was when we arrived. 
I was on the breakfast team, waking up every morning around 6am to go to the Oakland office to make up breakfast and lunch wraps.

On Wednesday night I crashed at one of the houses, I can&#39;t remember. Then carried my thingsto the office on Thursday morning, hoping to find a bed.
Thursday we organised at UCLA. Then an evening class.

It was explained how Will would wander off, and not organise in LA.

Friday we went somewhere in Orange County. I forget the local organiser&#39;s name, :she was an actress or something and had a &quot;Cutlass Supreme&quot;. 
Saturday there was a rally of illegal immigrants in Hollywood near the community college.

I don&#39;t know anyone&#39;s names here in LA.
I also haven&#39;t seen anyone we usually talk to here.

The recruitment effort enjoyed a measure of success. LaRouche&#39;s rather canny move as the Iraq quagmire set in was to position himself as kind of elder statesman in exile of American politics at war with the George W. Bush presidency and with Dick Cheney in particular. But the momentum did not continue through the next presidential election. The LaRouche resurgence seems to have been cresting around the time my article appeared.

Even so, the proselytizing campaign had done its work. The political ghoul got a taste of fresh blood. The young members brought with them the skills needed to burnish the movement&#39;s previously dismal web presence. New faces appeared in the videos promoting LaRouche&#39;s latest warning that a financial, thermonuclear and/or bacteriological catastrophe was coming in a few months, instead of the familiar ones who&#39;d been issuing virtually identical bulletins for 30 years.

It might be funny if not for the realization that those people were sacrificing their lives, talents and minds at the altar of a megalomaniac&#39;s narcissism. Thomas Pynchon might as well have had LaRouche in mind when, in The Crying of Lot 49, he referred to &quot;the true paranoid for whom all is organized in spheres joyful or threatening about the central pulse of himself.&quot; Perhaps the creepiest thing about his followers&#39; web presence now is that the spheres have kept spinning even after the pulse was gone: they quit broadcasting or publishing him in late 2016, which would have been unlikely if he were still capable of putting together a remotely comprehensible sentence.

But in revisiting LaRouche here after all this time, I want to end on an encouraging development that seems likely to be repeated, in various forms, before too long. In September 2012, several young recruits who were being groomed as leaders &quot;compile[d], in as much detail as possible from our combined experiences, a report of the events leading up to our departures from the LaRouche organization.&quot; Running to 75 single-spaced pages, &quot;Why We Left&quot; is difficult to follow on first reading and has its baffling moments the second time through, too. But in brief:

The older generation of supporters is made up cliques almost as hostile to one another as they are to the younger generation of supporters. LaRouche celebrates the younger ones at every opportunity, permitting them to do the fun part of being his disciple -- i.e., research and writing -- while longtime members work the boiler rooms, phoning people who have donated in the past in hopes of squeezing more money out of them. Various backstabbings occur. The nonagenarian LaRouche becomes noticeably confused at times. He also tries to woo a woman not quite a third his age. (She thinks about it.) Most of the events unfold at one or two locations; tensions seem to ricochet in an enclosed space. The whole document feels like equal parts Peyton Place and the Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders.

When approaching global catastrophes are announced, then fail to come to pass, it doesn&#39;t bother the old-timers. But it compounds the growing cognitive dissonance among some of the youth, who also suspect they will be put on the phones for fund-raising before long. Individual doubts slip into conversation; when not pushed down by the urgency of preparing for the next catastrophe, they start to accumulate, leaving a sense that the whole organization is out of touch with reality.

Dear Colleagues,
We have long believed the foundations of our association to be built upon a commitment to the pursuit of truth. In that spirit, we have chosen to compile, in as much detail as possible from our combined experiences, a report of the events leading up to our departures from the LaRouche organization. We feel that you deserve to know what happened, and to finally hear our reasons for leaving, &quot;from the horse&#39;s mouth,&quot; so to speak. The accusations made against us as to why we left are conscious lies, manifesting the same spirit of corruption and cover-up that provoked us each in our decision to depart. The chief reasons why we chose not to discuss our thoughts more publicly will be revealed by what is related here.
We no longer subscribe to the belief that withholding crucial information from other members of the organization for the sake of &quot;the mission&quot; is more important than truth. The truth must be told, let the chips fall where they may. What is related here is true to our best knowledge of how things unfolded, and is documented in order to provide access to crucial information which has been heretofore suppressed or obfuscated. What you do with this knowledge is ultimately up to you. We act of our own sovereign accord, under no influence by other persons, monetarily or otherwise. Though the composition and compilation of this dossier has not been an easy process, we felt that it must be done; for ourselves, for the sake of truth, and for you.

And the influence of Galileo, who was actually a sort of a high priest for Paolo Sarpi, in developing this crazy system of empiricism, uses one method. But Kepler uses another method: Kepler’s thing, especially on the question of his so-called “Third Law,” the harmonics, recognizes that there is a different sense organ than either sight or hearing, expressed in the laws of the universe: something which is neither. And that is what he wrestles with, in dealing with this question of the organization of the Solar System.&quot;
From http://www.larouchepub.com/eiw/public/2007/eirv34n38-20070928/25-30_738.pdf

Note: Larouche misses the point (and contradicts himself): Galileo shocked the beliefs of his time after he used TECHNOLOGY (a telescope) to see what eyes couldn&#39;t! He is rightly considered as the founding father of modern science and scientific method.

After Galileo published his Starry Messenger, Kepler wrote a glowing open letter of admiration to Galileo, and this helped Galileo obtain a post as court mathematician to Cosimo II Medici, Grand Duke of Tuscany, despite the hostility and skepticism of Italian astronomers about Galileo&#39;s findings.</tw-passagedata><tw-passagedata pid="339" name=":Plato v Aristotle " tags="Quote" position="2075,6800" size="100,100">the entirety of the history of European culture from the third century A.D. has centered on an irreconcilable conflict between the republican heritage of Plato and the oligarchical heritage of Aristotle

During these thousands of years, until the developments of approximately 1784-1818 in Europe, both factions&#39; inner elites maintained in some fashion an unbroken continuity of organization and knowledge through all of the political catastrophes which afflicted each of them in various times and locales
...

&quot;Unbroken continuity&quot;? Although LaRouche never explained where this &quot;revelation&quot; came from, consequently his adepts thought this revealed &quot;secret knowledge&quot; was the mark of his &quot;genius&quot;.
&#39;&#39;In reality, LaRouche picked this from his then-beloved philosopher Immanuel Kant!&#39;&#39;

Kant - History of Pure Reason
... Aristotle may be regarded as the chief of the empiricists, and Plato as the times followed chief of the noologist. Locke, who in modern Aristotle, and Leibniz, who followed Plato (although in considerable disagreement with his mystical system), have not been able to bring this conflict to any definitive conclusion...

in conclusion and according to the Neo-Platonists themselves, there was NO contradiction or &quot;irreconcilable conflict&quot;, between the &quot;Top-Down&quot; method of Plato and the &quot;Bottom-Up&quot; method of Aristotle!
This is very far off from LaRouche&#39;s Manichean simplistic view on that question! In fact, it is fair to say that most of the Neo-Platonists considered Plato as the resolution of this quarrel, very similar to a Leibniz&#39;s. Even Leonardo da Vinci was an avid reader of Aristotelian literature.

He whispers to the person he has selected as his next dupe, pointing the accusing finger against me: &quot;He is trying to change you!&quot;
To that, the credulous dupe, looking SATAN in the eye, asks, credulously: &quot;Is that what he is doing?&quot;
SATAN nods a knowing nod.
The dupe&#39;s eyes widen. Anger seeps into his facial expression. &quot;Then, he is really a very bad guy!&quot; the dupe exclaims.
&quot;Yes, he is a very bad guy,&quot; SATAN affirms, indulgently, as he touches the dupe&#39;s sleeve lightly with his own little finger; &quot;perhaps somebody should do something about him.&quot; The dupe&#39;s expression darkens. &quot;Really?&quot;
To do what must be done at the risk of that SATAN&#39;s—and the Venetian financier oligarch&#39;s—displeasure, is to be a true teacher, a true leader. That such leaders might arise from the ranks of today&#39;s young adult youth, is my intention for the impact of the LYM upon our imperiled civilization of today.&quot;

...
The tactic and method behind the creation of this LYM (not so new, there was his RYM antecedent) were comparable to to Mao Zedong&#39;s  &quot;Cultural Revolution&quot;&#39;s when creating his Red Guards Youth movement (a cult of personality) as a tool to control his rivals (aka &quot;old guard&quot;).

&#39;BOBOS AS A NO-FUTURE GENERATION&#39;
The Present Dark Age In Education

LaRouche Youth Movement Campus Tactics Questioned
LaRouche movement&#39;s comparisons must be ignored

Issue date: 12/6/06 Section: Opinion

Our campus is a place of political free speech, much like other universities throughout the nation.

We allow the voices of both competing sides of the political spectrum to establish themselves in this place of open thought-provoking debate.

Most of these political organizations are moderate and sound in their claims, while others are provocative and extreme. Nonetheless, they all receive a fairly equal opportunity to present themselves and be judged by the students they try to influence.

There is one activist, arguably the most extreme in his political views, who has no problem dishing out hurtfully slanderous criticism against public officials.

His name i:s Lyndon LaRouche, and while most students have probably never met the man, we all know what he looks like. Displayed on large print photographs that hang from the tables of his &quot;LaRouche Youth Movement&quot; like the Communist banners that once draped the eastern bloc, his face has become a symbol of an extreme radical and, dare I say it, cultish movement.

A radical politico like LaRouche who resorts to, and endorses, articles that contain such harsh terms as Nazi-Gestapo, fascist, and Children of Satan, would appear on face value to be inviting open criticism of his ideas.

However, any person or group that opposes him is immediately lashed out at with blitzkrieg-style slanders. Typically, these efforts are reserved for hard-line right-wing conservatives, but recently LaRouche turned his attention to a UCLA student publication, attacking it vehemently and ruthlessly in an attempt to discredit Garin Hovannisian, a student who wrote an opinion piece titled &quot;Expose: The Cult of Lyn LaRouche.&quot;

The noticeably hasty response, written by Aaron Yule of the LaRouche Youth Movement and published in LaRouche&#39;s latest pamphlet, &quot;Is Joseph Goebbels on Your Campus,&quot; attacks Hovannisian using the same cookie-cutter tactics they have been using for years: Draw ridiculous parallels between the targeted individual and Nazism in the hopes that readers do not possess enough of a historical background to seriously question the merits of the author&#39;s claims.

In Yule&#39;s article, he writes &quot;another case of this continuing Gestapo onslaught,&quot; claiming a supposed Gestapo-style campus attack against LaRouche &quot;is against their most feared adversary, LaRouche and his youth movement.&quot;

Let&#39;s take a moment for commentary. Nobody fears LaRouche and his youth movement, he is the object of ridicule in most debates and his &quot;movement&quot; is more like a campus street team, it advertises for him, but doesn&#39;t exactly define a generation of students.

Yule goes on to identify the young Gestapo sympathizer and expose his notorious affiliations. &quot;For example, the so-called &#39;independent&#39; campus newspaper at UCLA, the &#39;Bruin Standard&#39; (owned by the Buckleyite Collegiate Network), has run increasingly scurrilous slanders by its chief editor, Garin Hovannisian (the SAF president for UCLA), attacking the LaRouche Youth Movement as a &#39;cult&#39; that wants to &#39;brainwash&#39; students.&quot;

It is sad if people buy into this, but otherwise hysterically ironic tha

Hans wanted to know why I didn&#39;t have plans to develop the solar system.

I tried to explain that with the time and distance involved, it wasn&#39;t practical, and that more importantly, I didn&#39;t particularly care about developing the solar system.

Hans wanted to put 200 billion people on Mars. Then he started talking about how modern science was a conspiracy against human progress. Then he asked why I hadn&#39;t read the complete works of Kepler. Then he talked about Bush and the Right-Wing Conspiracy. I think all my professors were in the conspiracy as well. If I disagreed with anything, Hans would say, &quot;How do you know that?&quot;

&quot;I read a book on it,&quot; I would say.

&quot;A book? What, so just because it&#39;s in a book it&#39;s suddenly true?&quot;

As most conversations with LaRouchies, it went nowhere.

===
You can&#39;t out-crazy the LaRouche People
It may be tempting to try — but these guys are wicked jaded to crazies. When I worried that 200 billion people on Mars could lead to interplanetary war because there was no mutually assured destruction, Hans listened with a straight face and explained why that wasn&#39;t very likely. If you want to try to gradually escalate the story into the ridiculous and see how long it takes them to notice, it doesn&#39;t work. You can&#39;t out-crazy the LaRouche People. When they talk about the imminent collapse of civilization unless we build a nuclear-powered desalinization plant in Gaza, they&#39;re completely serious.

===
They also get some kind of bizarre spin on what each of these people valued. Kepler and Leibniz are good. Newton is bad. Riemann good. Aristotle bad. They will say things like, &quot;In effect, Fermat, and later Leibniz, were defining the completed paths from the standpoint of the &#39;moments of becoming.&#39;&quot; If this doesn&#39;t make sense, it&#39;s not your fault. Fermat and Leibniz didn&#39;t really write those things — at least not in the way the LaRouche people are spinning them. They may also use words or terms you&#39;ve never heard of before, like &quot;physical economy.&quot; Some of these are special LaRouche words that either have no meaning or mean radically different things in the rest of the world.

USA, 2007: Ex. LYM Akka and jmp87 about LYM.
Akka: Posted on Thursday, May 24, 2007 - 6:15 am:

Hi everyone, I used to be a member of the LYM but dropped out. I&#39;ve been reading your posts and have recognized a lot of the problems I encountered myself; especially the way the boomers are treated, and off course as, jmp8 points out, the horriffic living conditions. I was only member for about 6 months, but still I&#39;ve used a lot of time afterwards to process all the new impressions and ideas I was exposed to. Like jmp87 I&#39;m still inspired by some of the core ideas, and also the vigor and virtue og some of the youth members. On the other hand I totally recognize the cultish feats that seem to permeate the org. Contrastng the passionated intellectuals, wanting to make a difference, I saw deeply emotionally disturbed kids´who were more or less clinging on to LHL&#39;s fatherly figure, and would cite him all the time without actually thinking critically on their own; &#39;Lyn says this, Lyn says that&#39; therefore its right. The reason I left was that I, first of all, was unsure of the truthfulness of the theories I was presented to - here especially how history was presented, which I found contained a lot of contradictions.

Secondly I kept asking myself: what are the long term effects of this movement on its members? And when I saw these phone teams, composed of middleaged people, calling all day, 6 days a week, I could vividly imagine how these people once were young and full of good pretensions, like the youths, but now were stuck in this obvious miserable condition - a lot of them just looked like they were worn out. This was not the principle of &#39;the general welfare&#39;, promoted in the campaigners.

Although I&#39;ve left, I still have some contact with the movement, mainly because im trying to figure it out. How it works - and if I should support it or not. You&#39;ve all been through it, and it obviously has left som deep scars in your souls. I myself am very affected by the experience and I think about it daily; It really was a turning point in my life, and In many ways I felt very connected to what it means being a human being - as opposed to the extremely superficial reality of popular youth culture today, of which I was a part. This sense og humanity is something I still cherish and is grateful for. The most fundamental discovery I made, was that life is not some relativistic soup, were one opinion was as good as any other - there is such a thing as quality, were one way of thinking supersedes another because it&#39;s based on truer axioms than the other; implicitly - that truth exists and is attainable by humans; if they seek it rigoriously and open-minded. For me, this was a wonderful idea that actually gave my existentialistic life, some sort of direction and ground for optimism. This is a grand paradox for me: how can something that brought me insights and true joy, also seem like a freakish cult that is destroying lives? XLC4life mentioned an ex-member, Zubrin I believe, who apparently has specialized in Mars or something. Didn&#39;t he get something good out of the org? I mean, is the organisation really bad in all respects, and doesn&#39;t it also depend on the individual that joins?

Excuse my english - or at least the grammar - its not my main language!

borisbad: Posted on Thursday, May 24, 2007 - 9:41 am:

Akka, I can see from your post that you went through quite a transformation and fortunately you managed to retain your sanity being in for less than a year. Clearly, people join an organization like the LYM because they are dissatisfied with what they see around them and would like to see changes. And there is certainly much to be said about the banality of much of popular culture both today and in our day (the boomer generation). But then again popular culture was never equated with higher culture even Lyn likes to pretend that in the old days everybody studied Shakespeare, Goethe, Schiller, etc.

The thing about Lyn is how he cloaks himself in the authority of others who actually have made great contributions whether in arts, politics, math, etc. Then he construes vast machinations to show how the bad guys (whether called Aristotelians, Synarchists, Babylonian whore supporters, dionysians or what ever) are trying to stop whatever machination Lyn is perpetuating at the moment. The key thing is that you retained a sense of independent thought that made you look a little bit behind the shadows in the cave. When people give into anything uncritically, then they get trapped into cult thought. For example, Lyn likes to praise Plato, but ask if he really wants anyone in the organization examining the apriori assumptions behind his axioms and negate them which is the method behind Plato&#39;s dialogues.

I would agree that getting out of the organization doesn&#39;t mean you have to just become apolitical or uninvolved in seeking change. I think there are many activities and groups that may espouse ideals at least partially in line of what you are looking for that don&#39;t demand the total sacrifice of your identity.</tw-passagedata><tw-passagedata pid="346" name=":report on LA meeting" tags="" position="1625,6975" size="100,100">LYM’s Southern California headquarters is a decrepit two-story structure in Eagle Rock, a short hop from downtown Los Angeles. C.J., who is waiting for me at the back door, escorts me inside. LaRouche propaganda is everywhere, even in the kitchen and bathroom. The largest area is set aside for volunteers who work the phone lines, talking it up with potential recruits.

In the library I find texts by Plato, Kepler, Gauss, Leibniz and Schiller, but Aristotle is banned. Sir Isaac Newton? According to LYM leaders, he’s a fraud and plagiarist. Only “pro-mankind” intellectuals are permitted. Charter member Cody Jones explains to me that science, economics, politics, culture and music are all measurable by a “mankind yardstick.” Pro-mankind: LaRouche, Plato and Bach. Anti-mankind: Aristotle and Rachmaninoff.

Later, everyone is summoned to the conference room, where an ensemble performs Bach chorales. Phil Rubenstein—a balding, spectacled fellow in his 50s—takes the stage for “the weekly update.” Rubenstein, who claims to be a minister, fires off a homily on the “major political force in the U.S.—the LaRouche Youth Movement!” This becomes a routine reassurance, I soon learn.

There are conspiracy theories (“The economist George Schultz is behind it all!”) and hush-hush secrets (“Tuesday, Lyn [LaRouche] had a private, off-the-record meeting with 12 development sector embassies”). Rubenstein’s camaraderie with the younger members gives him easy access to their malleable minds.

Once the official program concludes at 8 p.m., I stick around to mingle, hoping for casual conversation. My efforts prove futile. LYM followers never watch movies, don’t listen to music (other than the prescribed dose of classical), don’t tell jokes and don’t have hobbies.

Individual egos have been replaced by a collective identity. Every pursuit, aspiration, passion, emotion and thought revolves around “Lyn,” as members reverently call LaRouche—“the founder…the genius among geniuses…the leading prophetic figure of modern history.”

Dreadfully tired, I cannot survive any more of this. I say goodbye to C.J., gather my bags and leave LYM’s little empire.
</tw-passagedata><tw-passagedata pid="347" name=":Untitled Passage 40" tags="" position="1925,7100" size="100,100">I&#39;ve mentioned in the past that I had some involvement with Lyndon LaRouche and his international political organization. That&#39;s really a polite way to refer to a man who leads a powerful and destructive cult which operates internationally and has a strong presence here in the United States, particularly on college campuses. From 2000 to 2001, I worked for him on the streets, on college campuses, at post offices and county buildings, in airports, in front of libraries and supermarkets, at busy intersections and on freeway off-ramps, raising money and spreading the word: &quot;The world was headed for certain doom and LaRouche is the only force in the universe who can stop it. Now buy a subscription to our newspaper.&quot; I worked 16-hour days and lived on about $30-$40 a week. Sometimes $50 if I was lucky. If this sounds bad, know that I got off easy. I recruited people into this group myself, and many of these folks are still in lockstep behind LaRouche. They were young people just like me: disillusioned, intelligent and creative, just looking for answers and an alternative to the mainstream path which seemed empty and unfulfilling. Worse off than these people, however, are the ones who have spent most of their lives there, people who joined when they were younger than I am now, and are older than my parents are today. I won&#39;t name a:ny names. I am not looking to make enemies, or cause any strife.

I am not writing this so that I can talk about LaRouche. There have been plenty of people available to do that over the years, and there will continue to be. The person I really want to speak up about is John Morris, who was one of LaRouche&#39;s faithful organizers. LaRouche is alive and well, still preaching his twisted gospel and abusing his membership more than enough to keep them in line and maintain a healthy flow of cash. But John Morris is dead. This is the news I received the other day that has left me so upset on many levels. He died one a night last June at about 10:30pm, along with Gary Genazzio, an organizer I did not know. They were on a highway between Chicago and Detroit. Their car had run out of gas, and they pulled over to the side of the road, apparently to try to refill the tank. A passing dump truck hit them and killed them both.

Maintaining friendships was not easy. The work was often too all-consuming to make room for strong personal friendships. In fact, allegiances to anything other than LaRouche and the rest of the group were strongly discouraged. I remember a couple of months after I joined full-time, I had a conversation about my best friend with one of the local leaders of the organization.

&quot;What do you call him a &#39;best friend?&#39;&quot; he asked. &quot;What does that even mean?&quot;

&quot;Well, we go back. We&#39;ve known each other a long time. He understands me probably better than anyone&quot;

&quot;Does he understand what you are doing here? Does he understand LaRouche?&quot;

&quot;A bit,&quot; I said. &quot;I&#39;m still working on him.&quot; (Indeed, at that time, I was &#39;working&#39; on all of my friends, many of whom had long stopped speaking to me by the time I finally left LaRouche behind.)

&quot;Well. You do that. But if you can&#39;t get anywhere, you have to remember that there are more important things. You can&#39;t let him hold you back. You&#39;re going to have to leave him behind.&quot;

You can&#39;t take them with you. That was the message that I got from all sides. My friends. My family. I remember one night I invited my father to an evening briefing, hoping he would see something good in it that I hadn&#39;t been able to explain to him in private. Instead, my father was full of objections to the rhetoric, and left that night feeling angry and uncomfortable. A leader (or National Coordinator, as they are called) pulled me aside and asked that I never have him come by again.

The work was difficult. Raising money is exhausting work, but doing it for the long hours that I did is grueling. I rarely got more than 5 or 6 hours of sleep a night. Even more exhausting than this is living with the memory of some of the things I did: Manipulating people into giving up money they clearly wanted to hold on to, &quot;educating&quot; others that anyone who supports Israel is a &quot;Nazi,&quot; that jazz music is pure evil, and the entire environmental movement is a fraud were, in retrospect, some of the less humiliating aspects of the work. The most upsetting would probably be the giving up of the self. I willfully and gleefully gave myself up to be scrubbed of personality, taste and ambition, instead seeing myself as a conduit to funnel followers and money towards a man that I&#39;d been convinced was something of a savior. Indeed, the most devoted followers of LaRouche place him on a pedestal somewhere close to God himself. And that fact that LaRouche frequently stated in no uncertain terms that human society (and, indeed, the known universe) could not exist without him indicated that he felt the same way himself.

John Morris wasn&#39;t the only LaRouche member to die recently. Jeremiah Duggan is the most well-known example. The story of his death, which has still never been fully understood or explained, was carried on all the major news outlets when it happened. He was a young Jewish man from London, a little bit older than I was when I was in the organization. He had gone to Wiesbaden, Germany to attend a LaRouche conference in March, 2003, much as I had done less than two years earlier. He then attended a &quot;cadre school&quot; at a youth hostel there in town. It may very well have been the same hostel I stayed at when I&#39;d been there. Then he died. He had been alarmed by the things being taught by LaRouche followers at the conference and the cadre school and had become afraid. No one knows for sure what happened, but he had been running along the side of a highway. There&#39;s debate over how he died, but the official ruling from German police was that he&#39;d been hit by traffic. They ruled it a suicide, but there are many lingering questions.

Ken Kronberg died in 2007. He had been a tireless worker for LaRouche for 35 years, and ran the publishing outfit responsible for printing many of LaRouche&#39;s publications. The company was experiencing incredible financial shortfalls, and it looked like Kronberg was going to end up bearing much of the burden. On a day when LaRouche suggested that the baby boomers in the organization &quot;commit suicide,&quot; Ken Kronberg quietly threw himself off of a highway overpass.

I never got a chance to meet Jeremiah, and I knew of Kronberg only by name, :but I did know John Morris.

I don&#39;t know what he and Gary were driving such a long distance at that hour for. I don&#39;t know whether they were coming from a long deployment (standing at a small table selling subscriptions and literature, collecting names and phone numbers to call later), or driving back from an event. But I do know why they ran out of gas. They ran out because there wasn&#39;t enough in the tank, and there wasn&#39;t enough in the tank because there was never much gas in the tanks of LaRouche cars when I was in the group, when the stuff was well under $2 a gallon. I can only imagine that the problem was only more pronounced last summer when gas was $4 a gallon in many parts of the country. Gas tanks were never filled because cash from deployments was a precious commodity. It was always better to bring cash back to the office than spend it all to fill up a tank. Usually, there was only enough gas in our cars to last a day. At the end of a long day of selling literature on the streets, we&#39;d put a few gallons in, at most. Enough for tomorrow.

The cars were never in very good condition. Though these cars were used every day for driving over long distances (sometimes for 50 miles or more each way) they were rarely maintained. I remember a car or two in Los Angeles that didn&#39;t even have a working gas gauge. We always had a can of gas in the trunk of the car. If the driver of the car ran out of gas, he&#39;d have to pull over and re-fill out of the can. I&#39;ve heard that it was a common problem elsewhere in the country as well. Given that John and Gary were trying to refill their tank on the side of a highway, I think there&#39;s they may have had a car in this condition.

The LaRouche organization makes millions of dollars every year.

John had been moved to the mid-west a few years ago, but he was in Los Angeles before that. That was where I met him. Once I joined the group full time, I moved into an apartment with another organizer, paid for by the organization. John shared a place with another organizer only a few blocks away from mine. Working the kind of hours we did (16 hours a day, five or six days a week) made it hard to forge friendships. What interactions I did have with my colleagues were generally centered around the activities of the group. Indeed, focusing on anything other than LaRouche was discouraged and avoided. When I spent time with John, it was often easy to forget that I had changed my entire lifestyle, altered my entire way of being (at the expense of friends, family and personal tastes) for a cause dominated by one single personality.

It&#39;s not an easy schedule to adjust to. The atmosphere in a high-pressure, money-driven cult is one of constant demand. If you aren&#39;t focused on raising money, or otherwise furthering the cause, then you are being reprimanded for not doing so more effectively. (These reprimands continue even when you are working hard and doing the very best you can). I remember one night in particular not long after I had joined the group full-time. I went over to John&#39;s house for dinner on a Sunday night, our one day off. Upon arrival, I suspected that like everyone else in the group, John would want to spend our free time talking about LaRouche, or Friedrich Schiller, or &quot;psycho-sexual impotence&quot; (a blanket term for whatever was keeping us from raising more money), or how we could work towards meeting our quotas every day. Instead, John wanted to talk about beer. He took me upstairs and into his bedroom where, in his closet, he had jugs of beer fermenting. He then explained the practice of home-brewing. I was just 18 years old, and had never considered that a man could make his own beer. That night, over a simple dinner of salad and pasta dish with chicken and pesto, we enjoyed the finest beer I had ever had up to that point. A few years later, it was John I was thinking of when I decided to start brewing my own beer at my house in Humboldt County.

John expanded my ideas about food as well as drink. We both shared a love of Mexican food, and a particular appreciation for the La Estrella taco stands in the Los Angeles area. One evening, I was on my way out to grab a couple of tacos (a huge luxury) before spending the night fund-raising. &quot;Get me a tongue taco, will you?&quot; he said. I laughed, thinking he was joking. I&#39;d been eating taco truck fare for years, but had never considered sampling the less common meats: cabeza, lengua and tripas. &quot;Oh, I&#39;m serious,&quot; he said. &quot;You&#39;ve never had tongue? You call yourself a taco fan and you&#39;ve never had tongue?! There is nothing--Nothing--that beats some nice lengua sliced really lean.&quot; Well, that was enough for me to try it, and a mere half an hour later I had become a fan of the tongue taco. Even today, I rarely pass up a chance to have an authentic lengua taco (though such opportunities seem to be rather rare here in Manhattan), and I&#39;ve no one other than John to thank for this.

John also had a strong sense of humor, and no matter the circumstances, he always managed to make me laugh. Even after being yelled at for not meeting quota, being reminded of our general lack of worth, or bring subjected to a conference call in which specifically-named people were held up as examples of how not to be, John was always ready to put on a smile and share his good humor. He made the work easy, lightening not simply his own burden but also those of others.

(You can&#39;t take them with you.)

As I said before, having &quot;friends&quot; in the organization wasn&#39;t practical. I say that, most of all, because once you leave the group you are cut off from it. No one speaks to you. A friend one day, and then next day you are nobody to them. There were people I knew who were my age and shared my interests. We were all swimming in the same shit: the same abusive hours, the manipulation, the near-desperate poverty. We banded together. It was unusual to spend time alone even in the rare hours away from the office. I met good people while I was in there. Now, more than 7 years later, I look back on the experience and think more of the good people I lived and worked with than I do of the leaders of the group, and LaRouche himself, those who wielded power over us. There&#39;s a small core of people who made such an impression on me that I&#39;ve thought of them every day. Funny, intelligent, bright people. Folks I would be friends with right now if they weren&#39;t in the cult, if their impressions of the outside world weren&#39;t being manipulated, if they weren&#39;t expected to NOT SPEAK to anyone who has left the group. I&#39;ve always considered John Morris to be part of that group.

I&#39;ve always said to myself that if one of those people who was close to me were to call me out of the blue and ask for help to get out, I&#39;d do everything in my power to make it happen. And I admit that there&#39;s a fantasy I indulge in from time to time, one in which my old friends are free of the cult, have reclaimed their lives and are living happily. We are all in touch and helping each other through the recovery which never really ends. We enjoy one-another&#39;s company, and share humor and insight without the profound pressure and guilt.

But now, John Morris is dead. He can&#39;t be a part of that mental picture anymore. Learning of his death reminded me that this isn&#39;t a fantasy. There are some things that will never be fixed. It reminded me that I was one of the lucky ones. I could have easily stayed. I could have run out of gas between Detroit and Chicago instead of John and Gary. I could have been Jeremiah Duggan and, disoriented and afraid, run into traffic and gotten killed. Had I stayed longer, I could have even been Ken Kronberg, and thrown myself off of an overpass because I lacked the will and the strength to break free. Someone else could just as easily be writing these things about me right now. In essence, I survived that car wreck, that highway, that overpass, even though I wasn&#39;t even there.

I survived

You can&#39;t take them with you. This is true of your family and friends when you go into a cult, and just as true of your colleagues when you leave.

Even though I will never see John Morris again, I will still continue to think of him, and mourn the loss. He was more than a quota, more than a list of contacts, more than a LaRouche organizer. He was a human being with taste, humor and dignity. And, most of all, for a year between 2000 and 2001, John Morris was my friend.

Very charming guy and very friendly, he easily laughed at any silly joke. He wasn&#39;t like the others. I am so glad I finally opened my eyes to the sick bastards they were. Nick Walsh once told me that if I didn&#39;t drop out of school and join them full time I would be personally responsible for the deaths of thousands African and Palestinian children.

I met some awesome people too, though. People I&#39;ll never forget and I&#39;m sure that if I mentioned them, you&#39;d know them also. It&#39;s so sad and tragic about John, though. Cool guy.

AAP/June 19, 2001
By Adam Cooper
The parents of a candidate in next month&#39;s Aston by-election today said their son had been brainwashed by a right-wing racist cult that believes the Queen heads an international drug cartel.

John and Bronwyn Mitchell said they feared for their son&#39;s mental well-being because he had been brainwashed by the Citizens Electoral Council (CEC), an offshoot of the political group formed by US extremist Lyndon LaRouche.

But their 21-year-old son, Doug, today remained defiant, saying he would stay with the group, which he said had given him a &quot;classical education&quot; and taught him &quot;real history.&quot;

&quot;I&#39;m going to stick with CEC until we win the fight and get our ideas across to the people,&quot; Doug Mitchell said.

CEC has offices in Coburg in Melbourne&#39;s inner north and bases its beliefs upon those of 78-year-old LaRouche, a convicted fraudster and failed presidential candidate.

Among the group&#39;s beliefs are that the Queen of England oversees the international drug trade, her husband Prince Philip heads a worldwide conspiracy to introduce population control and that the 1996 Tasmanian Port Arthur mass shooting and Scotland&#39;s Dunblane school massacre were conspiracies.

The group has directed much of its hatred towards Aborigines, environmentalists and Jews; it&#39;s alleged one prominent Australian Jewish family gave the go ahead for the Waco siege in Texas in 1993.

Mr. Mitchell&#39;s parents said Doug had been persuaded to live with party members and run as a candidate for Aston, in Melbourne&#39;s east, since he met a party member and former school friend last October.

John Mitchell said Doug had changed from a typical university student to an outspoken campaigner in months, but said his son was too naive to cope with his new ideas.

&quot;He was always a quiet person but he seems to be on a high all the time,&quot; he said.

&quot;He&#39;s not on drugs...but they&#39;ve got his mind full of what he has to be focused on.

&quot;We are mainly concerned for his mental safety, I don&#39;t think he can handle it.

&quot;He&#39;s totally under their influences.&quot;

Doug Mitchell said he was hopeful of winning between five and ten per cent of Aston&#39;s vote and said the CEC was not a cult.

Claims the party was racist were &quot;total lies&quot; and &quot;pathetic, low, dirty sick tactics&quot;, he said.

&quot;I wanted to be independent and grow up a bit, instead of living a dull and bland life and have an impact on what is going on,&quot; he said.

The Aston by-election was called following the sudden death last April of Liberal sitting MP Peter Nugent.</tw-passagedata><tw-passagedata pid="350" name=":Plea..." tags="" position="800,6475" size="100,100">This is an Australian family’s plea to open the eyes of the people in Europe, so that they will take action against this cult...we have a family member in the group.
Australia has a branch of the Lyndon LaRouche cult and young people are sent around the world, including Germany, to carry out the group wishes.
This group cons young people into devoting their lives to a worthless cause
They prevent family contact - A normal political party does not prevent families from interacting with their members.
These are the things that have happened to our family member.
Working for the LaRouche means you have to recruit other people into the group. Rewards are given if you do manage to recruit a new member.
Work for LaRouche youth involves long hours per day. Reading and studying LaRouche publications, webcasts and LaRouche approved history books are a compulsory activity. Daytime hours are spent setting up tables in the streets, malls, colleges and universities selling their publications and recruiting people. Travel to country areas and interstate is also involved. Other activities we know of include disrupting university events, attending demonstrations, deliberately creating confrontations at political events and organising cadre schools.
Similar work is done in Germany when recruits travel there. Our family member was in Berlin for 5 months.
After an evening meal, the recruits are back in the office pointlessly working the phones trying to get subscriptions out of people until late at night. Work goes on during the weekend. Saturday is spent in the office again, fundraising being the priority. Indeed the Australian arm of the LaRouche group boasts about how much money they raise in relation to other parties in the Australian Federal political system.
Great importance is placed on cultural activities such as music, singing, poetry and play readings. These are approved by the leaders and keep the recruits busy with no time for family or outside activities. These cultural activities hide the mind control techniques used by the group.
Since we have been in contact with other families in Australia and around the world, who are in a similar position to us, we know that other young people and older ones in the LaRouche cult are being subjected to similar techniques of mind control at what is termed “ego stripping” sessions, to the detriment of their health in body and mind.
The LaRouche movement uses well-known names from the history of philosophy such as Plato, Socrates and Schiller to give themselves a perceived respectability in the eyes of the world.

By Garin Hovannisian | October 1, 2006 |

http://thebruinstandard.com/?p=25

C.J. was a changed man. His curly, blonde hair snaked into an anarchic afro. His face was unshaven. His shirt, faded and bleached, was half-tucked into oversized jeans. I hadn’t seen C.J. in two years. Back in high school, he was a real character-a no-nonsense, call-it-like-it-is skeptic, cynic, libertine, jokester, joke, poet, soccer star, recluse, opinion-maker-an alpha to the alphas, yet entirely content in his own thoughts, a bully to (and of) no one. His dream, he used to say, was to live in isolation on a twenty-acre plot of Midwestern forestry-just him and his gun, untouched by man or government. I expected never to see him again. But in April 2005, on the student thoroughfare of the University of California, Los Angeles (UCLA)-a menagerie of hyperactive campus propagandists-the familiar creature was hard to miss

A few months before at his city college, C.J. had been approached by a few young activists who pressed him to attend one of their weekend retreats-a “cadre school,” they called it. Grudgingly, C.J. decided to go. When he returned, he abandoned his school, his home, his friends, his personality, his humor, and every vestige of his past. He moved into a veritable commune as a convert to the mission, army, and cult of Lyndon LaRouche. Defender. Janitor. Distributor. Point-man. Middleman. Yes man. C.J. was doing it all.

On Bruin Walk, looking into my eyes for the first time since high school, he was already recruiting. He handed me a pamphlet. “You know about LaRouche?” he asked, soaring through the awkwardness without the slightest hesitation or embarrassment. I nodded, but I could not pay attention to his words. My mind was fumbling with questions. What had turned the old recluse into a pamphleteer and peddler? Was it a spiritual enlightenment that he was eager to find? Was C.J. playing a sinister practical joke that he, if anyone, could pull off? Or was he…brainwashed? In search of answers, I enlisted in the LaRouche Youth Movement (LYM).

On Wednesday, April 27, I attended my first meeting. The Los Angeles headquarters of LYM are contained in a small, decrepit two-story house in Eagle Rock, California. Its rooms are packed with LaRouche literature, videos, posters, campaign material, and junk food. The largest is the telephone room, where volunteers work the lines with potential recruits. It comes eerily close to a telemarketing station, a boiler room filled with sleazy hacks selling faux-politique-a pseudo-intellectualized statism-with the requisite inflection and lure. Except it’s not old people being gypped (though LaRouche sat in jail for five years for fraud and extortion). It’s meaning-thirsty college kids.

I maneuvered into the library and examined the collection, in my habit of judging a man by his books. Plato. Kepler. Gauss. Leibniz. Bach. Anderson. Poe. Schiller. And of course, LaRouche. A few Germans I hadn’t heard of, sure, but this was basically it. Excepting LaRouche webcasts, lectures from his representatives, and LaRouche’s own books and articles, this is LYM’s intellectual kingdom. Aristotle is banned. The Western Canon has vanished, without fingerprints. And don’t bother with Sir Isaac Newton, a fraud, plagiarist, and conniver. Only “pro-mankind” intellectuals make it into the library. LaRouche soberly asserts in an article, “Galileo, Thomas Hobbes, John Locke, the notorious Adam Smith, and the famous Rene Descartes, were, like Bertrand Russell and his devotees, systematically insane, in the strictest formal use of the term insane.” Evil. Insane. Anti-mankind.

I did not get this “mankind” thing. One of the original LYM members named Bo explained that science, economics, politics, culture, and music are all measurable by a “mankind” yardstick. Pro-mankind: Plato, LaRouche, and Bach. Anti-mankind: Aristotle, Cheney, and Rachmaninoff. “But how can I listen to a piece of music and be able to tell if it’s pro-mankind or not?” I asked naively. Bo, who is more comfortable in belief than in argument, slowly replied: “It just comes with the knowledge. Once you understand the politics and the economics and stuff, it’ll all fall into place.”

Sensing my curiosity, Bo invited me to a LYM cadre school the following weekend. That’s where C.J. had been converted. That’s where I would learn why.

If I return a robot, I told a close friend, you have the right to have me committed. With that, I set off with my SUV to the outskirts of mountainous Santa Barbara, California. Off the central roadway, one mile past Paradise Road, and another mile off-road forging rivers and zigzagging through the woods-the Oregon Trail experience-I realized that there might not be a chance to turn back.

My grisly imagination having refined horrific anecdotes of brainwashing and murder into half-expectations, I pulled into the campground and moved my bags to the guys’ cabin. C.J. showed me to the main cabin, where nearly fifty young recruiters (like C.J.) and new recruits (ostensibly like me) had already assembled.

Already in the opening address, the world conspiracy blueprints of Lyndon LaRouche were unveiled. “The Family, or The Foundation, is an organization of politicos that pick world statesmen,” said a pretty woman in her early 20s. “It is a real organization that is really involved in US policy-making.” This is pure LaRouche-talk. The urgency of LYM’s mission is justified by these underground, hereditary, secret-hand-shake societies that debase what LaRouche terms very loosely “the American System.” It’s a web of evil people, most prominently George Schultz, who “single-handedly chose Bush as president, Arnold as governor, and Condi Rice as protégé.” A later speaker would declare that the Tavistock Institute, a British psychotherapy clinic, “controls and manipulates major media through brainwashing. This isn’t even debatable. It’s been proven.” These are the puppeteers of the modern world.

But forget the world for now, because the establishments have schemed for decades to destroy LaRouche himself, having found their one-and-only formidable opponent. In the eyes of his followers, Lyn is an international superstar-the orthodoxy’s most vivid nightmare and the truth’s final promise of fruition. Indeed, the LaRouche history, as any of his followers will proudly tell you, is replete with CIA-brainwashed assassins, KGB snipers, and world bank hit squads all targeting their leader.

At night, I jumped among the “social groups,” hunting desperately for (I frustrate my ego in saying) a casual conversation. But among the several dozen followers, none exists. They never see movies. Beyond a narrow slice of classical music, they don’t listen. They don’t tell jokes and they are irritated when they hear one. They don’t have hobbies. C.J. told me not to bother scavenging for sex. Every pursuit, aspiration, passion, emotion, thought, longing, and joy revolves necessarily around the central personality, “the founder,” “the genius among geniuses,” the “leading prophetic figure of modern history”-Lyn. This is not some sort of poetic exaggeration. It’s their way of life. You eavesdrop on a conversation between any of these people at any time of day, and it’s always about the same stuff: constructive geometry, socialistic economic policy, inherently good classical music, Plato, Kepler, Gauss, LaRouche, LaRouche, LaRouche!

They seem to be normal teenagers and they span the racial, sexual, socioeconomic spectra. But they connect in a common anticipation of historic catastrophe and they survive on the lone faith of the corrective and redemptive genius of their movement. And that’s the cult, if you’ve been searching for it and if you want to call it that. There’s no Kool-Aid, no weird alphabet, no cryptic Bible Code. It’s a cult, literally, of personality: the intellectual, world-changing genius.

Yet despite suspicions to the contrary, no believer is as confident in his own genius (which is, at best, a potentiality) as he is in the collective genius of his movement. Behind C.J.’s rugged certainties rests a spirit that is crippled and an ego that requires constant attention-not because it feels it deserves it, but because it cannot survive without it. Indeed, C.J.’s family background, which is stained by psychological and ultimately physical abandonment, not only discourages self-esteem, but really forbids it. It is peculiar, then, that it was precisely at the pinnacle of C.J.’s family crisis and disillusionment-in the dark age of his self-esteem-that he joined a movement that called him a genius.

To modern researchers of self-esteem and mass movements, however, the fact is not peculiar at all. Eric Hoffer has written, “The less justified a man is in claiming excellence for his own self, the more ready he is to claim all excellence for his nation, his religion, his race or his holy cause.” In the holiness of his cause, C.J. is more sure-and this, again, I write with no poetics-than he is in his own goodness. His confidence in his own genius (and, hence, the desertion of the fear that he is not) depends, first and only, on the acceptance of the movement.

Hence, no movies, jokes, creative talent, personality-the true believers have no character whatsoever. It is impossible, save upon their mastery of the clichés of the cause, to differentiate them. There is no identity or knowledge, in any real sense, detached from the group. The concepts of “knowaspheres” and “musical dissonance” that supposedly divide good music from bad are totally lost on C.J.. But not for a moment does he doubt their reality. He will blame his own intellectual immaturity every time, even if it conflicts with the reality he sees.

One is all. And, of course, all is one in Lyndon LaRouche, polymath extraordinaire.

LaRouche, who calls himself “the leading economist of [the 20th] century,” proposes an accentuated statism, and it’s accepted as high novelty. The prophet in the wilderness yells apocalypse, and his followers panic. The detective in Lyn finds networks of secrecy, and C.J. is on a personal mission to sabotage them. The genius mathematician rejects Newton’s calculus and his students immediately discard modern math. The music theorist writes, “The Beatles had no genuine musical talent, but were a product shaped according to British Psychological Warfare Division (Tavistock) specifications, and promoted in Britain by agencies which are controlled by British intelligence,” and the movement learns to recite it.

By the cadre school’s second day, nauseous from the adoration (which at least matches the average church-goer’s piety), drained of will power, and dreadfully tired, I stood on the brink of insanity. Echoes of the same themes and people bounced in my brain. Knowasphere. Leibniz. Plato. Beethoven. Constructive geometry. Schumann. Gauss. Lyn. LaRouche. Lyn. I guess this was that moment in which so many had beheld their epiphany. This was when, tired but finally enlightened, I was supposed to fall on my knees and dedicate my life to the whims and wishes of a man. But for me, it was more torture than epiphany. I simply could not survive through the weekend. I said goodbye to C.J., gathered my bags, and got into the car. A mile through thick forests, several miles past Paradise Road, and now far, far away from this fantastic place of ideas and heroes and dreams, brewing in a cabin by a stream. It was as if it was all fiction. I was absolutely in a daze. And not for a couple of weeks did I actually escape the awful aftershocks, the lingering hangover of the LaRouche Youth Movement.

I experienced its heart totality in the last LYM meeting I ever attended, a few months after the cadre school. I sneaked into the conference room in Eagle Rock, and LaRouche was on the projection screen. The background was black. The voice was monotone. And for more than an hour, LaRouche was talking about hedge funds and mergers-and the really boring, economic lessons we might squeeze from the “General Motors debacle.” And here were twenty young people sitting in a small room listening with special attention, scribbling in their notepads, and nodding their heads again and again at the every thought, the every word, the every counterfeit insight of their leader-Lyndon LaRouche.

Since then, a mutual friend of C.J. and mine has asked C.J. if he would ever consider leaving the group for a few hours to have lunch with us. He has never been able to say yes. He’s too deep in his new reality. He is there with Lincoln, Plato, Jean d’Arc, LaRouche-the handful of genius individuals who have changed the world. He is there with three hundred young intellectuals who, if we are to believe them, will stage the decisive revolution of our millennium.

The movement is easy to satirize, discredit, and render insane. But the quiet existentialist in all of us finds herself faintly envious. For in all their delusions, LaRouche’s followers have on earth a cosmic certainty and security that we might only wish to achieve in paradise. It is a paradise, alas, that almost inevitably crashes. When it does for C.J., one psychological breakdown after another, he might be a free man again-but never, I fear, the endearing oddball of our youths.

By Martin Daly
Defectors tell of &quot;psycho sessions&quot; and relentless demand for cash inside the Citizens Electoral Council. A political group accused of dirty tricks and the brainwashing of recruits faces increasing hostility. Martin Daly reports.

A Melbourne woman has appealed to the American consulate to prevent her 16-year-old son from being taken to the United States for training with an extremist right-wing political cult, run by a convicted criminal, Lyndon LaRouche.

Ms. Narelle Stratford, of Rosanna, contacted the consulate after Mr. LaRouche&#39;s Australian branch, the Coburg-based Citizens Electoral Council, refused her plea not to take her son overseas.

Critics have accused the LaRouche movement of brainwashing followers in Australia, persuading donors to contribute money on the basis that the financial world is about to end, and running &quot;dirty tricks&quot; campaigns against its enemies, notably leading Australian Jews.

The CEC was formed in 1988 in Kingaroy, Queensland, in response to the rural crisis when many farmers were in danger of losing their farms. It became a successful grass-roots political organization with about 100 branches around the country, mostly in rural areas, but within a few years it was taken over by American LaRouchians and their Australian followers.

Since then, the CEC has been criticized for allegedly abusing its position as a political party and for discarding members and donors once they have contributed funds to the organization.

The CEC denies the allegations and blames former members for spreading &quot;lies&quot; in an attempt to destroy the CEC and Lyndon LaRouche in Australia.

But Ms. Stratford, one of a number of Australians to split from the CEC, said she was alarmed by the allegations. She also feared her son would be put through a LaRouchian &quot;Cadre School&quot; in the US, which she described as a brainwashing session to bind followers to the organization.

Ms. Stratford said the US consulate in Melbourne told her it could not stop her son, who has a visa, from going to the US. The CEC said Ms Stratford&#39;s son, a CEC employee, was capable of making the decision for himself and that he wanted to go to the US.

&quot;I know of no other employer that would pull this sort of stunt without asking the parent first,&quot; Ms Stratford said.

&quot;And if the parents said they did not want that to happen, it would not happen.&quot;

Former CEC members said the organization, often under the direction of a LaRouchian, Mr. Allen Douglas, from Leesburg, Virginia, held frequent cult-like &quot;psycho sessions,&quot; during which members were abused and told they must accept their crimes - including masturbation, sodomy and homosexuality - if they were to be cured.

Motherhood and the influence of women over offspring was often derided. Women were frequently referred to as &quot;witches.&quot;

One founding CEC member, Mr. John Koheler, of Kingaroy - who resigned after the LaRouchians &quot;hijacked&quot; the organization - said the CEC responded to his opposition to the Americans by telling him he was &quot;blocked&quot; and &quot;paranoid.&quot;

&quot;I told Al Douglas that he was a fascist bastard and then they said I was doubly paranoid,&quot; Mr. Koheler said.

Mrs. Rhonda Rotaru, of Colac, wife of Mr. Alex Rotaru, who said he was an &quot;intelligence&quot; officer for the CEC, also went through a &quot;psycho session&quot; because she refused to move to Melbourne with her husband. Mrs. Rotaru said she was criticized for breastfeeding her son at two years of age. &quot;I always thought breastfeeding was just a natural part of womanhood,&quot; she said. &quot;They said it was bad for a young child to be so dependent on its mother and that I would ruin his life. They made me feel as if I was the worst person in the world.&quot;

Mrs. Rotaru said the CEC tried to break her marriage. Her husband said he was called an &quot;animal&quot; during a &quot;psycho session&quot; and was asked if would leave his wife and children to live nearer the CEC in Melbourne.

&quot;They inquired into my relationship with my mother,&quot; he said. &quot;That was pretty much standard procedure. It was an interrogation. The whole aim was to create a new person, making your past totally irrelevant and giving you a new personality. &quot;No matter what you said, it was your mother&#39;s fault. It was pretty hideous stuff. Many people broke down and cried.&quot;

Mr. Rotaru said the CEC gave him the cold shoulder because he refused to give them part of his $100,000 superannuation payout from Telstra. Then, he said, they asked him to mortgage his Melbourne house to finance a trip to Australia by a senior LaRouchian, Mr. James Bevel, a former confidant of the late Martin Luther King. His wife refused to allow it.

A former Queensland sheep farmer, Ms. Julie Warner, accused the CEC of contributing to the breakup of her marriage, which led to the loss of her three sons in a separation case. She said she was virtually forced to remain in the US, fund-raising on the telephone for the organization, while the LaRouchians worked on her to wipe out her &quot;mother complex&quot; mindset.

&quot;They would tell you there was something wrong with your mind, if you are not pulling huge dollars in,&quot; said Ms. Warner, who blamed CEC &quot;brainwashing&quot; for bringing her close to suicide.

Ms. Warner said she worked in the ``boiler room&quot; - a fund- raising room with a bank of telephones - in Melbourne where she persuaded donors she knew to give the CEC about $60,000.

&quot;I believed that we were out there to help people who had got into trouble in primary industry and here they were taking all their money and leaving them,&quot; Ms. Warner said.

She said the CEC encouraged her to leave her family: &quot;They wanted to know how much money I would be getting from the property if the marriage broke up.&quot;

A farmer, Mr. Joe Vella, of Kingaroy, Queensland, said he sold almost $1 million in assets to clear debts and give his wife, a CEC member, her share of the family farm. He feared she may have given a lot of the money to the CEC.

Mr. Vella came into contact with the CEC after attending a meeting in Kingaroy. &quot;We are in financial trouble. They made us think they were going to save us and get the interest rates dropped...,&quot; he said.

He said the CEC&#39;s Mr. Michael Sharp, alias Michael Stark, stayed at the Vella home for seven nights. &quot;All we ever did was give him money. It was about three years ago. He used to say, &#39;We can&#39;t pay this bill.&#39; We probably gave him $2,000 in cash. Never got a receipt.&quot; He recalled the CEC instructing people not to watch television &quot;because the cartels would get us.&quot;

&quot;They are a horrible bunch of people,&quot; added Mr. Vella, who flew to Melbourne three times to try and persuade his wife to return. &quot;When I first flew to Melbourne, I could only talk to her sitting on the fence outside (the CEC office).

&quot;Later she agreed to talk to him in a bar, but only in the company of another CEC member. &quot;What really hurt me was that (the CEC member) said &#39;you and your children have a sickness of the mind which you have inherited from your father.&#39; I got up and punched a brick wall and then went outside and sat in the gutter for a while.&quot;

Mr. Victor Barwick, one of three sons of Queensland farming couple Doreen and Billy Barwick to join the CEC, said he went through &quot;psycho-sessions&quot; in Melbourne and in the US. He said Al Douglas told him he was having a &quot;psycho-sexual relationship with my mother. I was only 17 at the time&quot;, Mr. Barwick said.

Mr. Barwick said that on a trip to the US, Mr. LaRouche told him there &quot;was a dark age coming, that learning would be done away with and that most people would be slaves.&quot; Mr. Barwick was paid $200 a week by the CEC for fundraising up to 12 hours a day, six days a week.

One of the primary aims of the CEC is to raise money. It has raised $900,000 for each of the past two years and is one of the largest political fundraisers in the country, although the CEC has been deregistered as a political party.

The relentless demand for cash from donors comes from &quot;Upgrade Teams&quot; that travel Australia to persuade donors to increase contributions. Fundraisers are often trained by American LaRouchians who travel here on tourist or business visas.

Mr. Victor Barwick said teams in the &quot;boiler room&quot; sell subscriptions to La Rouche and CEC publications for up to $600 a year.

&quot;I think they rip people off,&quot; Mr. Koehler said. &quot;It (the CEC) is immoral and corrupt...they frequently do not use the funds for the purpose they are raised for. It should not go into some kind of a slush fund. Obviously it does...a considerable amount does. The public needs to know that this operation is not in the interests of this country and they should not support it.&quot;

Donors have told The Age they were encouraged to go into debt without telling their spouses so they could give money to the CEC. One woman said her husband had given the CEC about $80,000. &quot;They (the CEC) do use members like puppets. I am trying to get my husband out of it,&quot; she said.

Ms. Kerrie Watterson, from Cranbrook, north of Albany, Western Australia, said she was persuaded by a CEC member to get a Bankcard so she could quickly donate money to the CEC if they needed it for an emergency.

&quot;Against my better judgment, I got a Bankcard,&quot; said Mrs. Watterson, who was then persuaded to use her maximum credit line to donate to the CEC. &quot;Overall, they did me for about $1,600.&quot;</tw-passagedata><tw-passagedata pid="353" name=":Fact-net 2005" tags="" position="275,6725" size="100,100">FactNet postings by &quot;Maia,&quot; an ex-member of the LaRouche Youth Movement, March 2005
&quot;Maia,&quot; Thurs., March 10, 2005, 02:18 AM

As far as why I got out, first off I was really lucky, my significant other who wasn&#39;t in the org managed to pull me out and helped start putting some sense back into me even while I was still involved, getting me to the point where I could start looking around and seeing the horror spectacle that I was involved [in], getting control of my faculties again.

One of the things was that It gets a little tiring making a fool out of yourself every day standing on [a] street corner asking for money like a homeless person spanging (spare changing). Another thing was, watching Lyn on video, listening to him talk...everyone kept saying he was intelligent but he just kept repeating the same things over and over again. When someone would ask him a question he would break into a 20, 30, sometimes 40 minute explanation that not only made little sense, but always fit neatly into this &quot;these guys are evil and want to destroy humanity&quot; routine. A basic student of sociology and/or human studies can tell you, human beings, the majority, and yes there are evil psychopaths in the world, but the majority are not out to destroy the world, they are simply doing what they think is best and, well, human nature is really freaking complex--it can&#39;t be nicely packaged into good and evil slots. All he kept saying was, Dude X is evil, Dudette Y is a spawn of Satan, meh....

While I was in, I saw two things happening almost two different orgs, for one The top down structure of the organization coming from Lyn, I assume, as I had no way of knowing much of what went on in the chain of command, but nevertheless was textbook cult, even though at the time I was only realizing it subconsciously. From the ground up though, and I almost think of it as a force, particulary the new members you could say were pushing the org towards reality, towards real ideas and real productivity. Needless to say, that doesn&#39;t last long, the new recruits get swallowed up and merge with the homogenized groupthink--that or they are kicked out or pushed aside.

The lack of identity among the boomers in particular was scary. Someone like Ted who would literally stalk me to make sure I wasn&#39;t doing anything non-LaRouchie, oh and yes, Liz, big Mexican girl, really really big, if anyone here has been in or was in the L.A office. Fucking psycho. If anyone was having a normal conversation (even about LaRouchie stuff) she would come in and scream at them to get on the phones. It was her and a number of people like her that made [me] do a double take on the whole thing.

You can&#39;t say that you&#39;re against government austerity measures and bitch about Argentina raping their people when you make your own people live on the exact same bread products day in and day out. Work them to the bone, then when you get sick, they tell you that you are blocked, when you complain you haven&#39;t got your 20 dollars stipend in over a month and they make you feel awful for even thinking about it.

It&#39;s really hard to pin down one thing, it just came down to, I guess...the complete lack of concern for the mental and physical health of the youth. As I think about it, it makes me cry for the people I met that are still in it. People that I felt really kindred with, some I never got to know, but wanted to....the ones I met that were still holding on to their own identities and weren&#39;t quite being swallowed up so quickly....

So anyway, that&#39;s my rant for tonight.

Peace and butterflies.

&quot;maia,&quot; Fri., March 18, 2005, 04:26 AM

So I&#39;ve been at a training all this week (a real conference) and before that the last function I had attended was an ICLC conference. I can say there is a dramatic difference between a cult conference and a real conference. It was the first thing that occurred to me, so many things It would be hard to put into words.... it&#39;s rather scary though how the organization is able to convince you otherwise of things you knew before you joined.

They actually had me believing, or starting to, that the LYM was the only org in the world that was actually DOING anything and all the other non-profits were a bunch of impotent Satan worshipers with an Oedipus complex....

I would really like to get some sort of livejournal community going. Maybe I&#39;ll just go ahead and create one and post an invite on here. I find there isn&#39;t much out there, even as far as forums. I&#39;m not much with what they did in the 70&#39;s [and] 80&#39;s, but I would like to find out the truth to some things. Being in the LYM raised a helluva lot of questions, about self, about the world, about the organization.

First off, how the hell can an orginization built on such a premise as it is, reach a point where the youth are recruited, burned up and used as fundraisers in an obvious freak show, that doesn&#39;t do anything to accomplish the goals it&#39;s supposed to? Was the org ever serious about it&#39;s goals? Was LaRouche ever sane? Why the hell does Robert Beltran [the film actor (&quot;Star Trek Voyager,&quot; &quot;Eating Raoul,&quot; etc.), now an ardent LaRouche supporter--DK] work with the org????? I personally got acting lessons from him, talk about having a hard time believing you&#39;re in a cult when a Hollywood actor gives you lessons every week. I feel so sad for the kids in the org, some of them are fucking geniuses, not very many, but some really got brains behind them and my God to throw it away on some madman&#39;s fundraising scheme, to talk of the dignity and honour and beauty of the human being, and then stand out on the street corner like a freak eight hours a day getting laughed at, accomplishing nothing but pissing a few people off.

Some of the things I learned in the midst of the tragedy that is the LYM will stay with me for life. I would like to continue some of the passionate study of Shakespeare, of all the great poets... It&#39;s hard saying what exactly made me leave, there were so many factors, but I would have to say it had to do a lot with the very thing they would have me study about: the dignity of a human being, the power of the heart to open the mind....there were so many contradictions in it all. Even reading back through this [message thread], Tom (I knew him personally too which even makes it more depressing) mentioned Schiller talking about the mind being opened through the heart, yet practically in the next sentence ranted on about how the emotions needed to be eradicated. [&quot;Tom&quot; is a person who was defending LaRouche on FactNet.--DK} It&#39;s so weird, Schiller talks about how reason is no good without compassion and love, yet supressing the feeling state, as they call it, is [the] number one priority. Oh, and don&#39;t even get me started how the org can say that and then praise Shelley to no end, when he contradicts everything the org stands for....He would rolling over in his grave.....grrrr. Okay, that was my rant....signing off.

okiemute, 

When, for how long, and where were you in the cult? I was in from May or June to October 2003. I have bipolar disorder, and I was kicked out because I didn&#39;t agree with them about, among other things, how I should manage my own health (they didn&#39;t think I needed to manage it at all). 
I&#39;m trying not to think about it too much lately, and I only check this board once in a while, and I try not to post too much, but I think this is an important issue. They actually believed that my illness didn&#39;t exist, that they could cure it by insisting that it didn&#39;t exist. The LYM believes it can just remove a person from their environment, make up whatever story they want about them, and the real person ceases to exist. Why not? They can make the real person seem to stop existing when they get them to stay a lot of the time. 
But, hey. I&#39;m lucky. At least I&#39;m alive. 

http://www.justiceforjeremiah.com 

Really lucky. 

There was also a 19-year old guy whose parents were posting here a while ago because they were really concerned because he was involved with the org and they thought he may have asperger syndrome. 

The nature of the organization is manic-depressive and schizophrenic and alcoholic. The most offensive thing in the world to them is someone with a pre-existing mental condition who is in treatment. Anyone who has ever been in any kind of counseling is more threatening than any of the groups they&#39;re always vilifying in print and in their class meetings. The cult would not function without denial. Anyone who strives to be happy and healthy is truly its worst enemy.

===

You think about your old school friend who joined...

===

I was in a transitional time in my life and didn&#39;t know a lot of people. I was opposed to the war in Iraq and was eager to hang out with this political campaign that professed to feel the same way I did about the war. 
They were nice for about a day, then they started making more and more demands. 
With my personality, I guess there was a little bit of an adrenaline rush when I found out they might be dangerous. I liked arguing with them. I didn&#39;t know how to leave when I found out I was trapped. 
I never really knew what kind of trouble I was in until I was out of the cult for a while and got some distance from it. 
They told me not to read anything about LaRouche that wasn&#39;t published by the org. They told me not to read anything that wasn&#39;t put out by the org, as it was &quot;bullsh-t&quot;. I tried to ignore this. It seemed so simplistic and I always hated people telling me what to do like I couldn&#39;t make these decisions for myself. Logic was outnumbered. I didn&#39;t know that many people locally. The closest people to me were long distance. 
I visited my family that year, a little earlier than the usual holiday season. I talked to some of my family members about it. One of them, I told about LaRouche&#39;s book, &quot;Money is an Idiot&quot;, and how he and the senior members are always telling the youth that money can&#39;t talk to you. They said they thought it was interesting that he felt the need to tell people that money couldn&#39;t talk to you. It was funny, all the stupid things I&#39;d noticed that it didn&#39;t occur to me that that was odd. It was such a wild, wierd world, that something like that could easily be insignificant. 
This was around the time I was kicked out. I really had to talk about it. I don&#39;t think my family fully understood how confused I was. I said. &quot;People say he&#39;s anti-Semitic.&quot; We looked it up on google. A whole bunch of quotes came up by LaRouche that were clearly Anti-Semetic. I&#39;d done it before by myself, but the cult says that&#39;s no good because everyone is lying. It still took me a while after that to realize that everyone else isn&#39;t lying; the cult is.

This cult traps well-meaning (usually young) people who already believe (usually) in the value of the life of the mind and who have a strong sense of justice coupled with a desire to right wrongs. The cult of LaRouche is one-stop shopping for such people: it supplies definitive answers to all life&#39;s questions (appealing to the young and/or naive who mistakenly think such a thing possible) and supplies a means at the same time of improving the world. Of course no one group let alone an individual human being has many - let alone all - answers to the big questions. But as you, I was in a transitional period and did not know what my next step was to be when these people entered the picture. I then found it much more convenient to &quot;change the world&quot; rather than to engage in the far more challenging task of changing myself.

For Erin and others who read this. 

You are absolutely correct in describing the initial experience as an adrenaline rush. When you are in your late teens, there are many paths to take. People who have open hearts and wish to solve some of the more pressing problems can be easily attracted to a group like Larouche&#39;s. At the time I started to read their publications, I skimmed the crazy stuff and concentrated on what I believed in. It was refreshing to see an org which wanted scientific progress as the basis to solve mankind&#39;s problems. It was great to see an emphasis on classical arts, literature and history. The counterpoint to the other extremes of society were welcomed by me. 

When the problems of the world are reduced to simplicity and the solutions are reduced to simplicity, it does intoxicate you with the idea that you are part of a solution. 

The lunacy will usually be noticed by people who are skeptical, or cynical or just plain experienced with life. Those of us who are not so jaded will somehow look the other way when the evidence starts rolling in about Lyn&#39;s lunacy, the anti semitism, the crazy life and how every criteria for a cult is being met. 

If you examine the history of the cult by reading this forum you will see how history has been repeated by Lyn over and over for another wave of recruits.

Ever since ive been acquainted with the LYM (handful of years), they have been fiercely proclaiming a housing market collapse. In contrast, the housing market fiercely ascended during the interim. 

I remember, month by month, the predicted collapses which had never occurred. Today, at the housing market’s maturity and amidst all the positive speculators, there are some economists predicting a dip, and rightfully so, but none are leaping into full scale economic shutdown predictions as Larouche did! –and today’s streak of housing growth is probably the reason their proclamations have faded away. 

And as much as we can argue the aforementioned, the end result will always remain: there was no collapse. 

But something detrimental did occur, the minds of the new recruits stayed around from month to month on predictions that have only led them into a brainwashed state of mind; thrown vulnerably into a surrounding of the most refined cult indoctrinating techniques. 

Whether Enron, Housing Market, or the Iraq War; the Larouche campaign is only riding the waves of media hysteria. With their picks, they throw the most extreme, fear inducing twists and correlate them to past writings to fit Larouche history and “prophecy”. 

And with all this said, they have transcended their focus from the housing collapse to Alito’s Schmitterian policies.

In a nutshell, Larouche consistently takes credit for battling, shaking up, and even causing significant blows to the financial oligarchs who have “taken over this world through wars and oppression.” It’s hard for me to believe that these extremely powerful oligarchs who “have directed the deaths and mental depletions of millions”, have not taken one action to place threats or cause any serious fear among the Larouchies. Not 1 Larouchie has died as a result of being “the biggest challenge” against the most powerful and vicious people in the world, the oligarchs. And mind you, these Larouchies are based in broken down buildings and drive broken down cars with bald tires, which means that they have a better chance finding death from the consequences of their own surroundings and poverty –and if you read up, that’s indeed how all of their deaths have occurred!
</tw-passagedata><tw-passagedata pid="355" name=":I am getting better story" tags="" position="2275,6775" size="100,100">I am going back to school full-time now; I also worked various minimum wage jobs after leaving. Working with real people, some of whom are living paycheck-to-paycheck, helped bring me back to reality. It brought me into direct contact with the realm of phenomena that we more appropriately discuss when talking about economic problems in human terms, i.e., in individual terms.

It was no longer some world-soul or nebulous noosphere who is suffering, but your co-worker and neighbor, someone you can&#39;t avoid getting personal with at the lunch-break. Not that LaRouchies don&#39;t live outright miserably. All the [LYM] apartments I saw/slept in looked like tenements, packed like slave ships by youths from various corners of the U.S. and world.

At any rate, starting from that sort of feeling about the average folks I got to know, now I at least have SOME sensual connection to people&#39;s actual experiences which is my own and has not been tampered with. I oppose this feeling to the feeling of looking at the pawns which are to be organized on the board, or the utter loneliness of being the ghost who has been forced to walk the earth for eternity, because of his knowledge of the secrets known to the inner elites. So, I&#39;m making progress.

It&#39;s somewhat impossible to feel anything about a completely abstract entity. As a LaRouchie, I had more feeling, on average, about the letter L than the people I was supposedly saving, especially when they weren&#39;t &quot;engaging in the dialogue.&quot;

The sh-t you have to witness in the name o:f Beethoven and Gauss and lately even God on those &quot;conference&quot; buses is appalling. People get wolf-packed and yelled at and shunned and all that just for not being willing to drop their views about the state of the economy.

When humanity gets this abstract, some third state of matter above the biotic, which escapes all sort of understanding due to the fact that it&#39;s &quot;currently insane,&quot; the results are drastic. I always consoled myself with the fact that there was a metric (PRPD) which we could measure and craft economic policy. But this sort of consolation is somewhat like a man saying that he knows that distance can be measured on a map, but can&#39;t for the life of him measure distance on a map.

To be honest this is not even a good analogy since there [in the LaRouche movement] the map was never properly formed to begin with, so any &quot;measurement&quot; on it would be worse than useless. An excerpt (below) from the resignation letters by Alice Roth, provides the opportunity for the observation that even at the top circles of the movement back in the days when people could actually talk about mathematical modeling, epistemology, ontology, etc. on a principled level, people never got to the point of actually using the magical PRPD &quot;yardstick&quot; as a measure of the tendencies in negative entropy or whatever PRPD was actually supposed to measure.

Because our so-called Riemannian model ignored the credit system, it was utterly useless for any kind of work involving short-run developments--i.e., the &quot;quarterly&quot; forecast. Yet it was demanded that we constantly produce such projections at a moment&#39;s notice for EIR. The best the staff could do would be to first figure out what seemed to be going on politically in the business community and among policy circles and then attempt to generate computer graphs that matched our already-arrived-at assessment. I found this degrading and intellectually dishonest. We were representing ourselves as one more &quot;delphic oracle&quot; among other competing &quot;delphic oracles.&quot; But the tools we were using were even less sophisticated than the Keynesian-Friedmanite rubbish we claimed to be replacing. The only thing that saved the project was that our political intuition occasionally was more on target than that of the competition.

And OUR political intuition generally WASN&#39;T, but I figured that maybe in the LONG run the predictions would be correct...

Comparing the boomer intellectuals with the LYM ones I guess entails at least a mention of Sky Shields. As far as I know he&#39;s still in and is as avid as ever. He was trying to organize some sort of LYM modeling crew last year to start producing those famed &quot;animations&quot; according to &quot;Riemannian principles&quot; at the locals, probably starting first in LA, the idea being that some people who knew some math and could program would, provided the data, be able to actually study something like the 1940&#39;s economic recovery premised on the science of Lyn. He saw it as a &quot;science driver program&quot; which would basically get the movement&#39;s sh-t together and fight its own ignorance. Sky was a pretty bright guy. I think he was studying physics and left somewhere around his third undergraduate year or something, but don&#39;t quote me on this. Either way, this as most things eventually was scrapped because the youth didn&#39;t understand Kepler, which is an obvious prerequisite for the active practice of modern science. Nothing against Kepler, but why not enter a monastery and study Cusa in detail? That wouldn&#39;t be a bad idea for a lot of the youth.

As far as the quality of scientific thinking, it&#39;s something like Stalinist dialectical materialism. Any decent argument by someone relatively competent can be squashed by someone with well-memorized Lynquotes.

I remember members discussing the movement of people towards and away from the [literature-sales] table and talking about it in terms of dynamically triggering a critical increase in the power of dialogue on the noosphere through singing, when people were just reacting to the outrageous signs and lyrics. Since there could be no science there, people end up discussing things impressionistically. In our sleep-deprived minds, the movements of crowds on the street started to look amazingly like some surreal version of Leonardo&#39;s sketches of water. People were creatures out of Goya&#39;s drawings, or Bosch&#39;s schizophrenic mind.

Really I think the most salient variable in any encounter between organizers and the public was how much the individual approached knew about the Great Patriot. I almost always started out the conversation with &quot;Do you know who LHL is?&quot; So much for now.</tw-passagedata><tw-passagedata pid="356" name=":Bruce Bash" tags="" position="2425,6775" size="100,100"> wouldn&#39;t be surprised if Bruce Director is a certified hypnotist, because people literally lose conciousness all around the room during his visits. &quot;Riemann: for Anti-dummies&quot; makes very little sense. I took it upon myself to read all of them a while back and I can remember very little of them.

Junior and senior members would try to immulate him in their briefings and classes on Wednsdays and Saturdays. They would go on for 3-4 hours, sometimes more. You would be sitting there (until you learned better) and the room would be almost empty and people were struggling to keep attention to the irrelevant material. In Los Angeles there would be more people outside smoking than inside getting brainwashed.

After a while in Los Angeles their was a huge issue over many memebers not attending meetings they had spent all week to bring people to. I&#39;m certain these long painful presentations were part of the reason.

Be careful earnest_one. Seeking out a a confrontation with LaRouchies on some of their faulty research can be appealing at times, but remember it will never get anywhere. As long as they are part of the organization they cannot do anything but constantly reaffirm all of LHL&#39;s postitions. 

They are encouraged to educate themselves as long as their conclusions reconfirms LHL&#39;s. 

His work is considered to be at the very the forefront of the &#39;organization&#39;. Every time he writes a new addititon to &quot;Riemann: To Confuse the **** Out of You&quot;, all the locals print out as many copies as they need to know it all by the next morning, then they have a class or 2, maybe several meetings to read it all together. All the locals write in the briefings what they have been doing with it. Then Director tours all the locals. 

Bruce Director&#39;s job is to keep the LYM mystified. The more they are confused, the more they are baited by some vast knowledge they can attain through the &#39;organization&#39;. </tw-passagedata><tw-passagedata pid="357" name=":Untitled Passage 10" tags="" position="1175,7475" size="100,100">Nght Bus?

In early 2004 it is crazy.
K. turns 18 and the branch goes out to a Spanish place, the chairman is vommiting, K. is vomiting.
The next day Austin and the gang set off the alarms going into the office at 5am to watch a LaRouche webcast. Having only recently joined he doesn&#39;t know the combo.

Deploy to Sydney for Australia day. Jo leaves with K. from there.

More people are recuited during O-week.
Long time supporters join up. etc. etc. team swells.

Deployment to Perth and Queensland, splitting the groups for three weeks. Rainy organising.

Cadre school before Easter.

Easter adventure.

Cadre school in June.

Cadre school in August, just before Federal election. Where afterwards when doing a campus march Sandy is met at Melbourne Uni.

The winter months are delivering New Citizens.
Members leave - with &quot;their own rubbish&quot;.

Just as the election was called you recruit Sandy (2 weeks later).
At first some of the guys are excited, because women don&#39;t stay single in the LYM for long and usually partner up with a member (SL - and her partner who left just before the election).
But she stays single.
She moves into the cool house, with Austin. Where the garage is a makeshift meeting room (full of couches).

There is the sillyness with K. W. and Austin, where after K. and L. breakup sometime before the election &quot;bed hopping&quot; ensures. There is an intervention where Austin just cries, it is a week or so after a post-election deployment to Sydney.
D. still is a supporter.
At the US conference Austin gets smitten for K. but when she rejects him, after leading him on kissing all flight, he gets anxious, and lost, but then in spite organises for just him to stay and organise in D.C. that angers K. who wanted him to change her plans too.

There is another intervention just before Christmas, because someone has shaved their pubes off in the bathroom sink.
They are thick so they think it is Austin.
After A. being told off for smoking pot at Easter, Austin just stonewalls it.

C. leaves and comes out gay.

Austin is a little annoyed because he doesn&#39;t get gifts from K. or L. like others...
Christmas day Austin stays in Melbourne, has lunch at the chairman&#39;s house.

Austin walks home to find Sandy with an old friend Cali. Cali is thinking of joining, and starts attending classes. 

When you organise in Broken Hill for Jan, Feb Sandy follows. Sharing the driving with W.

2005 - has its ups and downs.

Office is condensed, because not enough recruitment, and to save money.

J. leaves with a psychotic episode. Austin is torn because he is told not to talk to, or try to recruit him. When he talks about it later it is forgotten, or &quot;not talked about&quot;.
There were a lot of times, it was strange.
Kel says he wanted to walk through pokie machine rooms.
K. says he tried to make her have a panic attack driving to a comic store to sell his things.

Austin feels bad because he doesn&#39;t care for J.&#39;s things. Even before leaving for Ameria he felt bad taking the $40 to scrap the fridge J. owned. and donating the two beds he had.
All his boxes and things are stored under the house, and maybe not even sent to him as was discussed. Austin didn&#39;t help sort of pack J.&#39;s things.

She accompanies you and Adam to visit members of parliament.
Whilst there Austin catches Sandy having sex with another woman, a contact from their meeting.

Sandy begs Austin not to tell, the two spend all night sitting by Lake Burley Griffin, talking about the movement.
No plan to refocus in made.

the homosexual pathology, is destructive rage, a Nietzschean, dionysiac quality of rage. In the pre-1970s psychiatric literature, this was frankly and extensively documented. The pleasure of the homosexual deed is the pleasure of doing evil, in that clinical sense. It is not the desire for the act in itself, but the pleasure of the destructive character of the act as an affirmation of the diabolical, which is controlling.

 I hold that homosexuality, prostitution, and drug-use have no natural rights under our Constitution; indeed, both were outlawed at the time of our republic&#39;s formation, such that no judge can rightly claim the intent of the Constitution to afford special rights to these practices -  1987 - My Program against AIDS.

all evil religions are based on the &quot;mother principle&quot;: Ishtar = Shakti = Isis = Astarte = Cybele, an evil at least as old as the Ur of the Chaldeans from which the ancient Abraham departed. Similarly, all evil pagan religions, accompany this mother goddess (&quot;The Whore of Babylon&quot;) with a male figure of the type of a castrated phallus-god,

 Brainwashing techniques 
 Non-equiturs - &quot;polemic&quot; - Sandy actually taught Austin that what hethought was a polemic is actually a pattern of interrupt to try disorganise people into going with what you say.
 Overload technique - disolve attachment to fixed ways of thinking...
 The constant emergency - Collapse that must happen.
 
 LaRouche is a homophobe - because it is unnatural.
 
 &gt; But he wants a nuclear economy.
 Nuclear reactors have occured in nature - Uranium doesn&#39;t come out of manufacturing...
  (Austin feels bad, because he thinks they are trying to say, the nuclear fission and critical mass has occured in nature, that he had a talk on in 2005 when saying &quot;nuclear is sort of natural, like how fire is natural - and something to be harnessed&quot;)
  
  The first is that aspect of intimacies with either animals or one&#39;s own sex, intimacies described, for what are, biologically curiously inappropriate reasons, as &quot;sexual acts.&quot; Such intimacies fall within the provinces of statutes and morality. This is the aspect stressed by the current British press discussion, potential blackmail arising from the perpetration of such acts-presumably with one of the numerous, similarly disposed agents
  
  &quot;I disassociate myself from a policy of persecuting the victims of a certain, dangerous variety of neurotic, over-domineering mothering. I mean those persons who have found themselves most unhappily conditioned by such rearing into what are termed today &quot;homosexual impulses.&quot; A child of a household with a weak father, or of a broken home with no father present, is left almost defenseless against a certain type of domineering, neurotic-irrationalist, overtly sensually incestuous, mothering or surrogate mothering. Contrary to frauds more recently circulated within the psychiatric profession, the etiology of &quot;homosexuality&quot; is conclusively established.&quot;

In addition, sleep-deprived people have difficulties in initiating new projects (“amnesia of the future”), essentially preoccupying themselves with the daily routine. Perception of time is altered: sometimes the subject believes time passes quickly, sometimes that it is passing slowly.
Lack of sleep augments suggestibility; that is, if actions are suggested, the person will follow through, even though he wouldn’t have if he hadn’t been sleep-deprived. The potential for this increases with the use of alcohol and psychotropic drugs, and is accompanied by several hours of amnesia. For this reason, people can commit or be victims of criminal activities without being able to recall them. (4)

I have some thoughts regarding (most of) ex-members.

Ex-members played a role into building larouche criminal cult. How do they feel now about tragedies like Ken Kronberg&#39;s and Jeremiah Duggan&#39;s deaths? Do they feel any responsibility into not helping to expose the cult?

Most of them do not want to hear anything anymore about their larouchian past. Nothing happened, it was all a bad dream. Let&#39;s go back to what we learned so well: amnesia. Most of them feel embarrassed and sometimes ashamed.

I think that this feeling of silence and shame could be compared to... rape victims.
It is known that rape victims, especially when they are young, would keep their shameful secret for themselves and feel guilty for the rest of their lives. They don&#39;t want to talk about it. It&#39;s probably the same psychological mechanism for most of cult victims.

Does that mean ex members were just poor victims? No, they weren&#39;t. Unlike rape victims, the cult victims are also guilty as they were part of the offense... and enjoyed it!...

FROM:LAR       &quot; Lyndon H. LaRouche, Jr. &quot;
 CC:HZL
 SUBJ:REPLIES TO E-MAIL
 5:30 PM 8/5/2006  EDT

 -------------------------------------------------------- TO: DINO

 Your claim to have confronted me on truth is your lie.   It was you who
 lied, by persisting, still today, in your  fully witting, fraudulent
 fallacy of composition, about  the matter to which you referred.

         At that meeting, you took one fact from Spring of  1989, with
 the expressed intent to present it in a form  which misrepresented the
 issue of 1989 letter, which had  been, at that time, Ed Spannaus&#39; role
 as an enemy of me  and of Helga from inside the association. Your
 reference to the 1989 letter was explicitly fraudulent; it was done by
 you as your failed attempt to deny the reality of avowed  fascist
 Fernando coming out of the closet in September 1990, together with
 man-turned-whore Webster Tarpley. You engaged in this fraudulent
 representation of the matter of the Spring 1989 letter, as part of your
 own and Renate&#39;s continuing defense of Uwe Friesecke&#39;s attempted
 cover-up  of the  influence of the fascist scoundrel Fernando.

         As you know, I am certain, Uwe is, at last report, definitely
 not a spokesman for the Catholic confession, Therefore, Uwe&#39;s de facto
 defense of the fascist, non- Christian, Synarchist and Nazi elements of
 the Catholic Church, notably in Pinochet&#39;s Chile and elsewhere, might 
 be
 a mystery, unless we might discover that Uwe was in a  pact with other
 members who were in some way sympathetic  to the fascist circles of
 William F. Buckley et al. in  the U.S.A., Mexico, et al. Uwe&#39;s own
 motivation in the  issue  of the meeting at which you spoke,
 fraudulently,  of the letter, remains undecided,apart from the fact
 that was the only issue, of Uwe&#39;s attempted cover-up of the continuing
 Fernando problem, which had prompted that  meeting. You broke open the
 discussion at that meeting  with your fraudulently diversionary
 reference to &quot;the  letter,&quot; and your childish picture of the
 significance  of the role of  poor Paul Goldstein in any of the leading
 issues within Leesburg and related areas during the 1989- 1990 interval
 or beyond.  At that time, Paul was a relevant  issue only as he leaned
 toward support for Ed Spannaus in  common cause against Helga.

         As you know, unless your memory were more severely damaged than
 I could imagine, that what Fernando was in bed with was no mere
 Archbishop Lefebvre, but hard-core Nazism, or things comparable, inside
 the Church. Any attempted cover-up of Fernando&#39;s Nazi and related
 connections, represents an existential threat to the very existence of
 our association,and is evidence  supporting summary expulsion of any
 associate who attempts to defend Fernando&#39;s role from September 1990 to
 the present date. Nonetheless, you did lend aid to an attempted 
 cover-up
 of this fact, by the fraudulent character of your introduction, and
 flagrant misrepresentation of the irrelevant matter of &quot;the letter.&quot;

         Thus, we must conclude the following:

         The issue of the meetings in which you were a  factor, was on
 the subject of Fernando as an avowed  fascist; you intervened with a
 conscious lie in fact, by insisting on what was in fact a defense of
 Fernando, by implying that the September 1990 matter not be taken in
 account in my charges against Uwe&#39;s cover-up of fascist Fernando. You
 reference to the letter was therefore fraudulent, and intentionally so.
 Thus, you lied, and, according to your current message,  are lying
 still.  How could you debate issues of truth, when the power of
 truth-telling appears to have departed from your repertoire some years
 past.

         I concede, and conceded then, at a subsequent  meeting,  that,
 to your credit, as I credited you at that time,your discussion of the
 role of some of Fernando&#39;s  fascist cronies at the conference in Mexico
 was truthful  and useful. There, you did not lie; but you are still
 lying about the matter you treated in your first attempted,  fraudulent
 use of reference to the irrelevant matter of  the letter of 1989, a
 letter which involved, as Renate knew at the time, Ed Spannaus&#39;s fully
 willful wrecking of  the legal defense at the Alexandria trial, and his
 continuing focus against Helga during the period I was  sitting in the
 Arlington jail, where the meeting with my  counsel and Renate occurred.

 Renate, who probably instigated your first intervention on this count,
 is the more relevant culprit in this  affair; your role in the matter
 was, and, I assume, remains, as her accomplice, or should I say, out of
 my great kindess for memory of your better days, her  donkey.

 Dino, you are still lying.  I am deeply ashamed of what you, who used 
 to
 be a talented human being, have  turned out to become.

Hannover  7.11.06

 To: Larouche and the ICLC membership.

 As known to many, I confronted you personally on the issue of truth. 
 You
 had the possibility to defend yourself in that occasion, you did not.
 Since then, you have tried pathetically to cover your own behind, to
 cultivate a myth about God-Larouche believed by fewer and fewer. I
 decided that it was no more worth to try to have serious discussions
 inside the organization, but in the meantime your disgusting cowardness
 has forced me to face you again. Like a neapolitan witch, you think 
 that
 if you do not name s:omeone, that person will die, but witchcraft and
 tarot, as you know is fakery.  Your attempt to direct your hate towards
 Renate, with a language worth of homosexuals fighting in a Parisian
 bistro, forces me  to challenge you again. Lets have a debate, with
 equal time ( not your usual cabaret) on the history of the 
 organization,
 your private life  and everything else you want. I hope there are still
 members who are interested to know the truth and  given your famous
 courage when faced personally or your lack of fear when &quot;a light goes
 off in a room&quot;, I expect you will accept my challenge to you.

Open Letter #1 to LaRouche Youth Movement members:
Ah, the Youth--Lyn Finally Finds a Use for Them
&quot;The positions then switched--the children whose birth was previously regarded as tantamount to treason against LaRouche were now the ones he wanted, and their formerly important parents, the original members, the Baby Boomers, had now become the &#39;useless eaters&#39; and the saboteurs.&quot;
By &quot;eaglebeak&quot; (posted on Factnet, 04-27-2008, 12:38 PM)

Dear LYMers:

Do you realize that if your parents had been members of the Labor Committee, you probably wouldn&#39;t be here?

(Think about that the next time Lyn starts ranting about how Baby Boomer parents don&#39;t care about their offspring.)

Do you realize that when Lyn&#39;s first wife, Janice, had their son Danny, Lyn had a nervous breakdown and the marriage ended--because he couldn&#39;t take the presence of a child?

(Think about that during Lyn&#39;s rants, or perhaps while reading the startling self-revelatory &quot;Beyond Psychoanalysis.&quot;)

Do you realize that virtually every woman in the Labor Committee from the early 1970s through the 1990s--every woman who was fertile, that is--had at least one abortion?

Do you know that it sometimes took repeated &quot;interventions&quot; by the National Executive Committee and other &quot;leaders&quot; to force pregnant members to get abortions?

Do you know that in the 1970s Lyn declared that women want to have children only when they are tired of their husbands (a little autobiographical hysteria there)?

However, did you know that by the 1990s, he had refined that to declaring that women want to have babies only when they want to act infantile themselves?

Have you ever considered that maybe Lyn doesn&#39;t know that having babies is the way our species is reproduced?

Did you know that, although women in the Labor Committee were having abortions routinely, in the mid-1980s Lyn came to the position of opposing all forms of birth control for what we might call the &quot;broad masses&quot; of people?

And that meanwhile, the Labor Committee regarded abortion for its members as a form of birth control?

So that what he called genocidal in public was precisely the policy of the organization in private?

Have you ever considered the profound irony that the offspring Lyn had no use for when they were infants and children--if they managed to squeak by and live to grow up--became prime targets for the LaRouche Youth Movement?

And that the positions then switched--the children whose birth was previously regarded as tantamount to treason against LaRouche were now the ones he wanted, and their formerly important parents, the original members, the Baby Boomers, had now become the &quot;useless eaters&quot; and the saboteurs?

Say, did you know that, with Lyn&#39;s blessings, Nancy Spannaus ran for office in Virginia on a pro-life platform?[FN 1] You might want to have a far-ranging discussion about that with her one of these days.

The word you&#39;re looking for is &quot;expediency.&quot; That&#39;s the hallmark of Lyn&#39;s moral makeup, and that&#39;s what has enabled him to adopt truly Schachtian[FN 2] policies against the useless old in his own org.</tw-passagedata><tw-passagedata pid="366" name=":Untitled Passage 45" tags="" position="2875,7175" size="100,100">

She was mixed Anglo-Chinese, her skin had a rich golden or caramel undertoned glow, and a slight almond shape to her big warm eyes. Thin and short, some in the office were concerned she would float away from the table like a leaf.

It was expected someone would become her boyfriend soon enough. But Sandrina was sharp witted, joked around a lot and kept fit. The leadership accepted her being recruited, and she took up the room at &quot;125&quot; Elizabeth Street. Her room was between to Austin&#39;s, and the lounge where Rose slept. The back room had Stuart, who liked being a little out of the way.
The shed was set up with couches for informal meetings. Like the Cadre School debrief Sandrina had been recruited at, over a few beers. The back hallway had a bunk bed for guests, who often stayed over on Friday or Saturday nights, when the kitchen became a reading room.

… the oncoming waves of a great storm of global breakdown crisis are striking on the gates of the governments of the world, and are already pounding the hoaxster&#39;s illusion of Bush&#39;s economic recovery to shreds. The terminal breakdown-crisis of the 1971-2004 world monetary system is thus now fully under way.

Asserts his truths about the historic context of Plato and the penelonesian wars
Mirroring the current bush follies 

…The great leader for a time of crisis is onewhose selection breaks the rules, those rotten rules which are the relevant expression of the relevant, essential corruption. For that reason, society has tolerated only a relatively few truly great leaders for more than a short time. For example, as in the case of President Charles de Gaulle of France&#39;s Fifth Republic after 1963, the way in which bad governments recur or are maintained, is that the relevant leading institutions of society kill or otherwise eliminate capable leaders,..

…So, with rare exceptions, the most significant, but usually poorly sensed forces of history, proceed in long waves, even very long waves. The improved art of statecraft which our world needs for the present, and for the times before us, must return, away from the ruinous accumulation of present-day habits…

Annoying class in Seattle where Rohattan sounded like LaRouche - no one could notice it…

You are homeless, living under a bridge or what ever.

The game explains how you got there, and lets you make some choices to survive there.

Maybe you steal wallets, handbags, phones from people swimming by the river
Maybe you Jump trains, (http://www.runawayguide.com/runaway-travel-guides/how-to-jump-trains/) 
or hop a frieght train (https://anoniverse.com/how-to-hop-a-freight-train/)

Talk about wolfing - people who try to climb Mt Everest alone, using other peoples suplies (They had treked up). They stand alone mostly because they don&#39;t use guides, or sherpas, sort of preying on the sheeples that pay tens if not hundreds of thousands of dollars to climb.

Past issues could include:
At 18 you tried to go to uni, but that resulted in becoming homeless and having a breakdown. Talking to people they think you just got anxiety, or depressed, and couldn&#39;t make friends. But you had money issues, became homeless, then dropped out... (https://studyinternational.com/news/australia-university-homelessnes/) -(You think it would had been cool if it was like Shoplifters, where the poor sort of group together)
I couldn&#39;t bring myself to have a conversation with anybody - I looked at trains and wondered what it would feel like if I was infront when it zoomed by. But you also thought how that would fuck up the driver&#39;s life, and anyone else who saw it would be mortified, more than that time you saw a body when jogging in the morning.
When you moved away to Uni, on the first or second morning jogging you found a body. At first you noticed soiled underwear, then you saw her face, her neck was a different color to her face and her eyes and mouth open...
Your housemates were idiots, starting fires in the backyard and then a few weeks later you got an eviction notice. They smashed up the place including your things, leaving you to pick through it all a day or two later when you cleaned up with the landlord.

You actually don&#39;t know you&#39;ve had a breakdown, you don&#39;t want to be a burden.
ou can&#39;t stop it with rational or nice thoughts. You&#39;re stuck with it until it stops which can take days. You&#39;re overwhelmingly sad and absolutely uninterested in anything beneficial to your being like healthy foods or even eating in general, work, friends, family, no one else&#39;s problems will matter at all. All you can think about is how worthless you feel.

You have nice shoes - bright blue runners with the stripes. Retro looking.

Using terms like Minimalist - to say you have nothing.
Sleeping in an ultra-light setup (a tent, sleeping bag and cardboard matress) that all fits in a daypack. You look like some thru-hiker.
But it is summer, what will this be like in the cold of winter - when there is frost and rain that lasts all week.

Maybe traveling to a touristy town will help you blend in with backpackers, or young adventerous types.

On the train you remember the group of other guys who were coming home from schoolies. They had money...
you get $100 a week from Centrelink... and probably they will ask about your home one day soon.


[ ] You feel like a stray cat
The other homeless people are like cats, fighting, probably living with fleas, spending the day sunning on rocks.
Do you offer a pack of smokes to learn something?
Some people in the group are concerned for you. But maybe they just think you are living cheap close by the swimming area.

Will you loose more? Will you bag and tent be pinched?
Do you swim all day and try to forget everything?

Will someone steal your shoes as you sleep (likely a sadistic jogger, or someone not in the community fucking with poor people).

&gt; Game has a map of where you can go.
&gt; once there you can choose to do things.

&gt; At night you view the lights from some homes...

Cats... feral cats, snakes and other wild animals 

Have you already passed the census date (21 days after start of course)

What were you hoping to do by going to Uni?
How has that changed?</tw-passagedata><tw-passagedata pid="390" name=": Game IDEA - SHIP" tags="" position="12675,7575" size="100,100">On a cruise - sharing cabin with stranger
Attendee at wedding at sea of friend. There are 40ish party members.
You are a long time friend of groom. But not a best man etc.
Just along for the ride.
She is a cousin or some other friend to the bride.

The cruise is 8-9 days, and the wedding will be on the 6th day (on an island visit - that has a movie reference or something).

You don’t want to be a perv, and your cabin mate is a bit awkward. You are both late 20s, no longer in the hometown of the bride and groom. Feeling a little like loners…

You agreed to share because the rooms were booked out. She is paying half - but you haven’t sorted out how to split the onboard expenses.

Other than a phone call about paying, all the communication has been via the bride so far. So you hope she doesn’t have an annoying voice, snores etc.

Will she be thin? A boarding school girl (the bride&#39;s family is a horse family)
does she smoke? Or drink too much?

On the cruise will you both go your own ways at the ports?


The sea and locations are imaginary - there is:
1 - leave home port
2 - SEA
3 - SEA
4 - port 1
5 - port 2 (wedding)
6 - port 3
7 - SEA 
arrive home port


For replayability, have the itinerary on days 3-6 switch up (sometimes 2 ports, sometimes 3).

Each day
	Breakfast
	Morning
	Lunch
	Afternoon
	Evening
	Dinner
	Night
		sleep

How do you navigate her?
	As you aren’t in the wedding party you don’t have to worry about rehearsal, photos etc.

	but to get to the wedding - you need to get up a steep hill with your room mate at the port…

The cruise is small, every cabin has a window or balcony?
We can illude to the ship being 12 or 13 levels.

You are likely 4 decks below the pool, and two decks above the dining areas.


Meet 
	choose if you ask questions - do you snore? how do we divide up the rack in the bathroom? do you sleep nude, or are you ok getting changed infront of each other? when do you go to bed? when do you wake up? is it ok to bring someone else back to snuggle at night? Do we eat breakfast and lunch together? Or just the allocated dinners?

“where are you from?” 
How do you know the bride and groom?
Where have you travelled?

&quot;&quot;&quot;
I used the Guaranteed Share Program. The first two roomies were wonderful women to share with :); the third was not :mad:. The first two were cooperative, and were open about discussing how to room together for the enjoyment of both. The third acted as if I were an interloper in her cabin. :rolleyes: (the third one is the amusing story, though. ;))
I have not kept in touch with any of them.
&quot;&quot;&quot;

Remember use names in the first day - so they don&#39;t have to ask your name a few times.

Maybe have the delusional thoughts

Things like
* The economy is about to collapse, so what is the value in finding a job?
* Battle of ideas - thinking a real science is fakery...
* Really unhinged thought pattern to come to crazy conclusions...
* Sense of worthlesness - because of the thought stopping
* Risk taking - thinking the economy is going to end, so is gambling or something...

* Tripping when someone says they are interested - he is talking about something completely different
* Challenging ideas that aren&#39;t normally challenged

* Bad eating? Rough living?
These effected his mind, so when he turns up to hospital he loves that he has three meals a day, and a safe place to sleep.

Every year over 100,000 people will experience a psychotic episode for the first time, and there is a 3% chance that any one of us will experience psychosis during our lifetimes (source). It can be triggered by drugs/alcohol, trauma, or an existing mental illness, and can cause a serious and dramatic shift in a person’s perception of reality.

It is often brief and is something that can be remedied with the right care, but the abruptness and severity of a psychotic episode can leave patients, and their loved ones, in a very difficult position, even when it’s over.

In this guide, we’ll look at some of the ways you, or your loved one, can get back on track after such an episode.

Early Treatment is Important
It’s normal for people suffering from mental health problems to avoid seeking help. They either don’t want to face the truth or they don’t believe they can be helped.

This is also true with psychosis, though even more of a problem, as the very nature of psychosis means they simply don’t believe they need help. They may even convince themselves that the healthcare community is out to get them and therefore can’t help them.

Studies have shown that people suffering from psychosis take over a year to seek help, after which the illness has had time to take hold and may have damaged the patient’s social life, career, schoolwork, or relationships.

The sooner it is treated, the easier it is to manage. As psychotic episodes are far more common in teenagers and young adults, the onus on spotting this issue before it becomes a serious problem often falls on parents. Concerned parents should look for the following early symptoms in their child:

More socially withdrawn.
Distressed without explaining why.
Performing uncharacteristically poor at work or school.
Change in sleeping patterns.
Showing paranoia or suspiciousness.
Auditory or visual hallucinations.
The Acute Phase
The first course of treatment for psychosis is antipsychotic medication. These medications are administered during what is known as the “acute” phase, when the symptoms are at their worst. Patients may need inpatient care at this time, as they may still be in the grip of their delusions and could be a risk to themselves.

A treatment known as “rapid tranquilization” is often used during this phase. This will sedate and subdue patients, giving the medication time to work and ensuring patients do not harm themselves.

Life After a Psychotic Episode
The second phase of treatment is the longest as it can last for over a year. At this point, patients understand what they have been through and have begun to get back to normal, but they still require monitoring and medication in order to avoid a repeat of a psychotic episode.

Patients who do not continue to take medication after a psychotic episode have as much as an 80% chance of relapsing within 12 months, but for those who are medicated the rate drops to just 20% (source).

Medication may only be needed for a year, but it’s important to combine it with other forms of therapy to ensure a multi-pronged approach that greatly reduces the odds of a relapse and helps patients to rebuild their lives.

Studies suggest that the following treatments can help alongside antipsychotic medications:

Psychotherapy: This approach can help patients deal with any stress that the psychotic episode caused and any anxiety they feel about leaving care.
Cognitive-Behavioral Therapy: Known simply as CBT, this technique helps patients to recognize and analyze their thought patterns, which will allow them to better understand and manage their hallucinations and delusions, potentially preventing those thoughts from getting out of control if they happen to resurface.

Here are some common aftereffects that individuals may encounter:

Post-Cult Trauma Syndrome: This includes spontaneous crying, a sense of loss, depression, and even suicidal thoughts.
Fear and Guilt: Worries about disobeying the cult’s wishes or facing divine wrath can persist.
Isolation and Loneliness: Leaving behind a tight-knit community can lead to feelings of alienation.
Flashbacks and Confusion: Memories of cult life and difficulty distinguishing right from wrong may occur.
PTSD-Like Symptoms: Survivors may experience nightmares, anxiety, and disassociation even after leaving the cult12.
Emotional Roller Coaster: The process of rebuilding one’s life can involve anxiety, indecision, anger, and identity crises3.
Remember that healing is possible, and seeking professional support can be crucial during this challenging transition. 🌟

# Recovering from Cult Experiences: How to Recognize &amp; Resolve Aftereffects #

... Some cult members, when they look at their experiences in a closed, high-control group, that self-sealing system, may say that they liked it or it was easier or they wanted to be there. Some may say that get or got something good out of it. Remember, the fact that you got something good out of it – if you did – doesn’t mean that there weren’t also bad and harmful actions taken against you. I like to use the analogy that certainly there were some Germans who liked that the Nazis got the trains running on time, but that doesn’t mean that Naziism was or is okay and without fault. But as with most things in life, we don’t want to rush to simplistic explanations for this is an incredibly complex phenomenon. ...


... So let me begin with my version of what that structure was. It includes four interlocking organizational aspects:

* The authority figure, often a charismatic authority figure – although charisma is possibly less relevant in this situation, although the leader has to be a good-enough salesman and self-assured enough to be able to sell the program to unsuspecting parents, school officials, insurance companies, and so on;
* The belief system, which I see as a transcendent belief system with a required methodology for change, meaning that you are required to go through a personal transformation to attain acceptance;
* a system of control; and
* a system of influence

Charismatic Authority: The purpose of the first aspect, authority, is to provide leadership and direction. The leader’s goal is to be accepted as the legitimate authority on all things. This is accomplished by privilege, secretiveness, inaccessibility, power, and command, and the hoped-for effect is that the members, or subjects, will identify with the leader(s) and the group’s goal.

Transcendent Belief System: The purpose of the belief system is to provide a worldview, whose specific goal is to offer meaning and purpose through a moral imperative (“once you know this, how can you not act on it”). The doctrine is inviolable, untouchable, and comes down from on high. The desired effect of the TBS is the internalization of the belief system, which is to represent, in a sense, “freedom,” in the sense of being connected to the greater goal and aspiring toward a sort of salvation. Yet, this transcendent belief system upholds the dangerous philosophy of “the end justifies the means,” whereby blind devotion is a duty and helps turn the key in the lock.

System of Control: The purpose of the third aspect, the system of control, is to provide organizational structure and hierarchy. Rigid boundaries define inaccessible space and topics closed to discussion or inquiry. The specific goal is to put forth a behavioral system and a disciplinary code by means of rules, regulations, and a system of sanctions and punishments. The hoped-for effect is compliance, and better still, blind obedience.

System of Influence: The purpose of the final aspect, the system of influence, is to provide a confining social network of acceptable social interaction, and a group culture. Internalized norms, all-pervasive modeling, and constant monitoring serve to rule out inappropriate questioning and behavior norms and a code of conduct which members are expected to live by is the specific goal. That is accomplished by various methods of peer and leadership influence and modeling. The desired effect is conformity, or the self-renunciation required in order to remain on good terms in the group and one day attain the professed goal. Which I suppose is “freedom”.

I call this the fusion of freedom and self-renunciation. That may sound all high and mighty, but soon one realizes that there can be no freedom when one has renounced or denied the self.

All of these four parts fit together like a 3-dimensional puzzle. Everything seems to fit into this schema or framework, and very little happens by chance. Even external events are interpreted to coincide with the cult’s worldview – your life before you were admitted, your family and your role in your family, your schooling, your friends and acquaintances, your various life adventures and experiences. It’s all reframed to fit the schema of this new overarching system that envelops you.

For you, as the inmate, as the member, the goal was to perfect yourself against an impossible ideal, and to criticize yourself – and others – for failing to do so all along the way.

For the leader, the goal is to perfect a body of subjects, of followers, of acolytes, who will continually struggle for the impossible ideal, who will unquestionably carry out all assigned tasks, and who will laud the leaders and the institution all along the way.

When this process works, the fusion happens – and here I identify four more aspects, or phases: a bounded reality, the self-sealing system, personal closure, and a state of mind that I call “bounded choice” (Lalich, 2004).

This is how it works: you become locked into a bounded reality, created by the self-sealing system in which every aspect and every activity reconfirms and validates, not you, but the system. There is no place in such a system for what social psychologist Edgar Schein (who in 1961 wrote Coercive Persuasion, his research on Korean War prisoners of war) called “disconfirming information.” Nothing is allowed in that will challenge the system. The flow of information – in and out – is totally controlled. Not only in and out of the system, but in and out of you, of your mind.

In this situation, what occurs is something called “personal closure”—an idea first introduced by developmental psychologist Erik Erikson (1959, 1968) and expanded upon by psychiatrist Dr. Robert Jay Lifton (1969). (If you’re a reader, Erikson wrote some very useful books on identity and youth and the life cycle. And Lifton, of course, did the seminal work on “brainwashing,” which he called thought reform, first studying people in Chinese reeducation camps and cadre training schools, but then continued his work in the study of modern-day cults.) So, personal closure is a particular state of mind that is akin to a psychological trap.

Functioning within the group setting requires a commitment that demands singlemindedness, a style of thinking characterized by dogmatism and rigidity, and there can be no identity outside the context of the group. Because of the power that the authoritative leaders have over their subjects’ lives, the threat of disapproval and punishment take over one’s psyche. Along with this comes a paranoia that focuses on the system you are in (i.e., you become afraid to do something wrong and be chastised), but also raises the specter of the “evil” outside world.

Feeling duty-bound and obligated, members find themselves participating in or witnessing activities that in other times may have or would have violated a personal code of ethics. But now, the leader or leaders are the only moral arbiters. Through repetition, ritual, and other activities, this process desensitizes members to behavior previously considered by them unthinkable or objectionable (not to mention, society’s views of such practices). The longer a person remains in this setting, the more “invested” you are, in a sense, and all the more complicit perhaps with group actions, behaviors, and requirements. (This is where later the guilt and shame come in.) At this stage, life outside the group seems less and less available as an option.

And finally, by means of the processes of identification and internalization, you feel yourself enveloped within the group and at the mercy of the leader. You are likely to still be experiencing dissonance (“This feels good, but I know it’s wrong”; “The leader says it’s okay, but I think something’s off”; “Everybody else is doing it, why do I feel hesitant?”) and confusion, even though you may be conveying a sense of agreement. All this time, you have had access to fewer and fewer outside sources of information, and, therefore, little capacity for any reality checks outside the bounds of the system.

Additionally, you begin to feel completely separated from any sort of pre-group identity. After a time, you cannot imagine life outside the group. Here the process has come full circle – to the state of personal closure.

Personal closure is not meant in the sense of completion, which is one use of the term. We talk, for example, about getting closure on something. But here we are talking about personal closure, about boundaries around the self. Lifton’s usage refers to the closing in of the self in a kind of self-sealed inner world. Lifton described it as a “disruption of balance between the self and the outside world” (1969, p. 421):

Here, the individual encounters a profound threat to his personal autonomy. He is deprived of the combination of external information and inner reflection which anyone requires to test the realities of his environment and to maintain a measure of identity separate from it. Instead, he is called upon to make an absolute polarization of the real (the prevailing ideology) and the unreal (everything else).

The personal closure that is the culmination of cultic life is profoundly confining because the individual is closed off to both the outside world and his or her own inner life. Personal closure involves all aspects of your life. It’s about everything, all of your life, all of you.

It is also much vaster than our understanding of the normal processes of conformity because of the depth and extent of the internalization and identification. The quality of the belief change in these groups actually shifts a person’s value structure – either temporarily or permanently.

Within that context, all choices become institutional or organizational choices, and those choices are made by the leader, for no one else is qualified or has the authority to do so. Personal choices, should they even arise at all, are now formulated and constrained by the self-sealing framework and style of consideration, which always puts the organization first. Thus, your choices become “bounded choices” – hampered and confined by the constriction, not just of the system (which certainly has a role), but more importantly and more potently, by the constriction of your own thought patterns – which, once more, always put the organization first.

So, what do we have here?

The boundaries of knowledge have been shut tight and reinforced in three specific ways: through the process of resocialization, through the use of ideology, and through social control and influence. The goal of resocialization is the restructured personality, and this reconstruction often revolves around one aim: “to get the individual to identify with the socializing agent” (Coleman, 1990, p. 295) — in this case, whichever cult group or relationship you happen to have been in. In Goffman’s writing on total institutions, he describes a process that he calls the “mortification of the self “– the process whereby the individual is stripped of all support and what was familiar to him before. “Upon entrance…” he writes, “he [is subjected to] a series of abasements, degradations, humiliations, profanations of self. His self is systematically…mortified” (Goffman, 1961, p. 14). Self-mortification, role dispossession, curtailment of the self, obedience tests, will-breaking contests, physical indignities, forced confessions, all serve to create anxiety, loss of autonomy, and loss of a sense of safety. You know the drill. I don’t have to tell you. You’ve been there. Such an assault upon the self is the crux of behavior modification, of thought reform.

I cite these various researchers and professionals, not to bore you with academic references, but to help you understand that for decades there have been social scientists who have studied this phenomenon, who have criticized it, have pointed out the dangers and devastating effects. There is actually a long history of institutional abuse in its many forms – and you too are now experts in the subject.

The desired effect from the organization’s point of view is a new self whose actions are dictated by the will or purpose of the actor or leader he has identified with. This is why people obey even when they are not around the group. It is, then, that will, the internalized will of the other, of the system, that generates one’s own internal sanctions for future actions. Bounded choice is constrained, then, by both external and internal sanctions – real or imagined.

Voila – you’ve been resocialized!

And now for that burning question: How do I undo it?

Let me say first, for those of you who may be in pain, who may think the mental confusion and personal anguish will never end – I know it sounds trite, but it’s true that TIME HEALS ALL WOUNDS. So let time be your ally. And please take comfort in knowing that hundreds of thousands, if not millions, have gone this road before – and THERE IS LIGHT AT THE END OF THE TUNNEL.

But you can cut down the time and you can shorten the tunnel, for one, by doing what you are doing this weekend, coming together with others who have experienced the same kind of trauma as you have and engaging in what I call psycho-education.

But as to the question: how do I undo it? Well, I don’t believe that there is only one answer to that question – in fact, I no longer think there’s one answer to hardly any question, except maybe “what does 1 plus 1 equal?” One of the paradoxical consequences of living outside a cult or a closed system like you were in (and, by the way, from what I can tell, many of the behavioral modification programs that we’re here to discuss or you have experience with, that were and still are in existence qualify as a cult) – so one of the paradoxical consequences of living outside a closed system is that life gets more complex and a person is no longer satisfied with simplistic answers.

There are two fundamental axioms to remember in dealing with some of the aftereffects: (1) we are socialized to respond to and respect authority figures, and (2) we are social animals who respond very much to peer pressure. Keeping that in mind may help ease some of the guilt and shame.

When I work one on one with former cult members, there are several things I ask them to do that usually help, and that involves deconstructing the system to gain a full understanding of what was at play. And of course to recognize that because of what Lifton calls “milieu control” – control of information, of social contact, of outside realities – you were playing with less than a full deck. So in addition to the controlled environment along with the physical and psychological abuse, you were subjected to constant berating, badgering, exhaustion, malnutrition, various deprivations, all the while living in a depraved setting. So if you “bought into any of it,” if you succumbed in any way, don’t beat yourself up. What else could you have done? Give yourself a break. It’s time to take the pressure off. The keys to recovery are balance and moderation, both of which were quite likely absent in the cult.

At the beginning of this presentation I mentioned some of the typical aftereffects: anxiety, indecision, worry, fear, either too little or too much sleep, confusion, guilt, loneliness, flashbacks, shame, obsessive thoughts, depression, suicidal thoughts, identity crises, loss of memory, panic attacks, anger, and so on. If you are experiencing any of these, that’s normal. Some of the other more common effects are:

Cognitive deficits – trouble concentrating, an inability to think straight, things that may hinder you at school or at work.
Experiencing low self-esteem, self-doubt, questioning yourself all the time.
Feeling that you have regressed to a childlike state. Remember, you were in a situation that enforced a state of dependency and loss of autonomy. When I got out of my group at age 41, I always say I felt like a stupid 15-year-old and a very tired 80-year-old at the same time.
Sometimes feeling frozen with fear, unable to act or make a decision.
Wanting revenge. Not knowing what to do with all your anger.
Anger is a normal reaction to the hurts and assaults you experienced. Anger is an appropriate response to abuse and exploitation. Some say that feeling angry is one of the first signs of recovery. Just as fear is the backbone of cultic control, anger can be the fuel of recovery. It fortifies your sense of what is right by condemning the wrong that was done to you. It gives you the energy and will to get through the ordeal of getting your life back together. Suppression of anger while in the cult more than likely contributed to depression and a sense of helplessness. Now the reverse is possible. But bear in mind that anger can also be a double-edged sword, especially if turned inward, toward the self, or outward toward the wrong targets, innocent others. That reaction can lead to increased isolation. One outlet for many people has been poetry or writing to release the anger. Or writing letters that never get sent to former leaders. Don’t act on it willy-nilly. There is a big difference between thinking, feeling, and acting out.

I’m not a psychologist, so I can’t diagnose you, but most people coming out of such situations do get diagnosed with PTSD – post-traumatic stress disorder. That means the emotional roller coaster may go on for some time; you may step off and have smooth times for a while, and then the roller coaster comes by and swoops you up again. That too is normal. The most important and effective thing you can do is find those aids that work for you. This process may or may not include professional therapy. The healing or recovery process varies for each of us, with ebbs and flows of progress, great insight, and profound confusion at times.

I don’t like to tout my own book, but Take Back Your Life (Lalich &amp; Tobias, 2006), which was written specifically to help folks recover from similar traumatic experiences, has proven so helpful for many, many people. My coauthor and I were compelled to write the book because more often than not, people coming out of cults and extremist environments have difficulty finding practical information. I, too, experienced that obstacle back in 1986 when I got out. I seemed to encounter one roadblock after another when I searched for useful information or helping professionals who were knowledgeable about this type of trauma.

And there are other good books out there as well. Another book I recommend is The Language of Emotions by Karla McLaren (2010).

Dealing with your emotions may be one of the biggest areas of concern. Typically as we grow up, through life’s various experiences, ups and downs, we learn the skills needed to handle and cope with a variety of situations. But you were likely removed from life just at the time when most folks are experiencing life, learning to sort through the challenges and acquire those skills. You were in an environment where your emotions and perceptions were manipulated and controlled. So now you have to face that developmental task, and it may at times seem just too daunting. You may not even be able to sort out one emotion from another, or what is an appropriate or inappropriate response. So again, get some useful aids (such as the two books I just mentioned or a grounded therapist or a trusted friend), and start to identify and distinguish between your various responses and reactions. How is anger different from fear, from frustration? How is sadness different from loneliness? How do you react when you are anxious? What sets it off? What can you do to avoid those situations or approach them differently? Keep a journal or a log. Start making sense of it. But most importantly, find a comfortable pace for your healing process. In the beginning, in particular, your mind and body may simply need a rest. Allow yourself that.

If you are having triggers and flashbacks, there are little tricks and exercises in the book to help you through those. A trigger can induce a dissociated state accompanied by a flood of memories. Sensory triggers are probably the most common: sights, physical sensations, sounds, smells, tastes. These triggers are reminders of specific experiences or people and are unique to each person. They may bring back the ambiance of the place, or engender specific emotional states, or even physical sensations. You’re not going crazy when these occur, although you may feel like it. The process of becoming immune to triggers begins when you become aware of what triggers you. Get rid of cult souvenirs (or lock them away in a storage area if you think you may want to reference them someday); keep a log; stay healthy. Research indicates that triggering happens most frequently when you are anxious, stressed, fatigued, or ill; and secondarily, when you’re distracted, lonely or uncertain. This very gathering may set off lots of triggers for many of you, just because we are talking about these things.

And ask other survivors what works for them. But beware: don’t compare yourself to them or judge yourself by someone else’s progress. That’s never helpful. You are a unique human being with your own journey.

Recovering from this type of traumatic experience will not end the moment you leave the abusive situation. Nor will it end after the first few weeks or months away from the group. On the contrary, depending on your circumstances, aspects of that experience may require some attention for the rest of your life.

In an earlier book that I co-wrote with clinical psychologist Dr. Margaret Singer, we outlined five major areas of post-cult adjustment (Singer &amp; Lalich, 1995). These likely will be relevant to you as well. The five categories are practical, psychologicalemotional, cognitive, social-personal, and philosophical-attitudinal. I have a handout available that outlines these and some of the typical issues likely to come up in each area.

You may sometimes feel that it’s all one big murky mush that it seems impossible to get a handle on – that’s why I feel the deconstruction of the experience is so important. Some people have found it very helpful to recreate their time in the group – on paper, not in real life. Ha ha. Try to chart out what happened, when and why. Now it may seem counterintuitive to relive it, but the better you understand intellectually what happened to you, the better you will be able to handle it emotionally. You can chart out your experiences and perhaps leave a column on the right where you can jot in notes or reminders that will help you get a grasp on what happened and why.

If there was a specific ideology or belief system put forth, their philosophy of practice, the underpinnings of why they say they do what they do, take that apart as well. See if it has any theological or psychological roots that are valid; debunk it, so that it no longer has any hold on you. And perhaps there may have been some good elements – this way you can sort those out, and not have to throw out the good with the bad.

These exercises may not be easy to do. You may not want to do them all in one sitting. You may not want to do them if you’re feeling particularly vulnerable or shaky. You may want to do it with someone else, a trusted friend, someone else who was in the same or similar cult.

Learn to take things on a little at a time. Not every issue or aftereffect is going to be resolved at the same time. Perhaps make a list of the things that trouble you most, then prioritize it, and work on things systematically. Or if you reach a block, go back to your list and pick out some other area to work on. Don’t let it overwhelm you. Not everything needs to be settled today. You’ve got your whole life ahead of you.

If you no longer trust or feel you don’t know how to have healthy relationships, there’s a section on that in the book as well. Engaging in healthy and trusting relationships after such a traumatic and invasive experience as you have endured is one of life’s big challenges afterwards. But it’s important to take on this challenge eventually so that you can create a solid and trustworthy social network around you.

Establish a support system for yourself. Choose your friends wisely. Don’t associate with people who bring you down. Don’t think you have to tell everyone you 20 encounter what you went through. There is often a tendency to say too much too soon, with family, on the job, or with new acquaintances. That’s left over from the time in the system when you were allowed to have no boundaries at all and confessions were a constant. You now can establish your own personal space, and guard it well. When you begin to feel invaded or encroached upon or violated, or as though you’re losing your balance or perspective, trust your gut, your instinctive reactions. The bottom line is that you get to decide what feels safe and what you feel prepared to discuss or explain.

If you’re having trouble sleeping, remember the old remedies. Drink some warm milk. Play soft music. Go outside and get cold and then jump back in bed. That should activate your parasympathetic nervous system and slow your heart rate so that you will fall asleep.

Also, you may want to seek out an ethical cognitive therapist – no tricks, no gimmicks, no New Age nonsense. Just good old talk therapy. I realize that many of you may be hesitant to open up to any mental health professional after what you’ve been through and the way you were betrayed, but there are some good therapists out there who can help. There’s a checklist in the book for evaluating a good therapist.

I’m not a big pill pusher, but there are some very good medications available now for anxiety, panic attacks, and depression. You don’t have to suffer as much as you might be. Remember, you probably got used to suffering while you were confined, perhaps you became desensitized to that kind of personal pain, or you think you should just suck it up and take it. That’s a bankrupt philosophy. If there is a prescribed medication you can take for a time that will relieve some of your pain and allow you to function more effectively, consider it. Talk with your doctor or therapist about it. You probably don’t have to be on it forever, but it can be a wonderful short-term solution to getting through the really rough spots. I’m all for Happy Pills!

Find what works for you – and work on it. Do what you can when it feels right, and if it seems like too much, like you don’t want to think about it another minute, then don’t. Trust your gut; follow your instincts. You can now. It does get better. The pain and the bad memories, the nightmares, the panic attacks will recede into the background.

And never forget, you were strong enough to survive a most horrific ordeal. You are surely strong enough to succeed now.</tw-passagedata><tw-passagedata pid="414" name="Psychosis mixed up with Leaving cult" tags="" position="2000,1100" size="100,100">Leaving a high-control group or cult can be extremely traumatic and destabilizing. Psychotic symptoms might arise due to several factors, including:

Severe Stress and Trauma: The process of leaving can involve intense emotional stress, fear, and confusion. This can sometimes trigger acute stress reactions, which may include psychotic features such as hallucinations or delusions.

Loss of Identity: Cults often exert strong control over members&#39; identities and thinking. Upon leaving, individuals may experience a loss of identity, which can be disorienting and lead to psychological disturbances.

Isolation and Lack of Support: Former members may feel isolated from family and friends who do not understand their experience, leading to feelings of loneliness and abandonment that could exacerbate mental health issues.

Withdrawal from High-Control Environment: Adjusting to a world outside the strict control of the cult can be overwhelming, leading to anxiety and paranoia, which might manifest as psychotic symptoms.

The kind of books we have rarely time to read.

For the most important thing is to understand LaRouche’s thought. LaRouche would have made the famous discovery LaRouche-Riemand which allows us to know if the country’s economy is on the right track or not. It is this discovery that made him say that we are in a period of economic collapse.

Maybe, the problem being that no man knows what it is in the discovery that has allowed LaRouche to make these economic predictions.  Thus we linger over the texts of LaRouche in order to try and understand, but nothing happens and one does not discover any more.  Two topics are always present in LaRouche texts. He often speaks of History, making it fit his own views, the second topic is about human psychology, it is often presented as the difference between man and animal.

A young French girl Elodie Viennot, was recruited there during her architectural studies. The leaders of the movement of the young in Los Angeles, Harvey Schlanger and Lenie Rubinstein represent for these young people a kind of parents, of confidence. They solve all their problems. The young people of the Los Angeles are taken care of from A-Z by the three persons with whom they are in constant communication. Even when these youngsters travel abroad the American leaders ask them to remain in close contact.

From Breakfast to bedtime, the members are together. There are three meetings a day so that the youngsters remain under pressure.

She stayed about one year in Paris. She is the only French member, apart from Cheminade, to have a direct and permanent contact with Helga Zepp LaRouche, Lyndon LaRouche’s wife, and the European Manager of the organization.

Feeling the danger of these young member who had just been made responsible of the movement of the young LaRouchist in France by Helg Zepp LaRouche, Cheminade managed to isolate her. He sent her to Rennes in order to open a new office there, prohibiting certain members to go there.

In private Cheminade despises Elodie as he despises all his collaborators, but in public, Rennes was the spearhead of this movement in France Elodie having become the new Joan of Arc who was to liberate France.

The young members of Rennes were exhausted by the constant rhythm of life. They worked continually from 8.30 till 10 p.m. everyday without any real rest. They often fell ill. As they only sold a few newspapers per day they lived miserably. In February or March 2003 a Parisian member had to send them 100 Euros so that they could buy food. The rent of the apartment where they lived first three of them, then five of them, was paid out of the social benefit payments of a member from Rennes.

The members from Rennes lived in a real material precariousness but also a moral one.

Sunday 19 Feb - arrived in Seattle

Late Feb - Portland
Mid March - your stuff is stollen, and your things tampered with 2 or 3 times in a week, at the house you are staying in. Maybe money was stollen earlier, but you don&#39;t know.
Move to another house -

Wed 5 Apr - you get sick. Taken to Hospital at night, with swollen neck. Team member convinces you after waiting 1 or 2 hours in emergency to not see a doctor.
Thu 6 Apr - go to second hospital, seen within 10 minutes.
Not sure how the bill worked -
need to get cash sent to you for medicine. It is $200 for 3 days course of pills.
You stay couped up in house, no food for a day and a half. But it probably made you unwell.

Saturday 22 Apr - your class cancelled - because you are shit

California Cadre School

Friday 28 Apr - California Democrat Convention Sacremento

Trickle into Montreal - your plans to go to Germany or France cancelled !

Sunday 7 May - Walk around New York (Quiet Sunday night)

(78 Days in USA.
It was rough, sleeping on a couch, having your stuff stollen.
The office is poor, dumpster diving for bread. You also have no money.
Some people looked out for you - the girl who had an immigrant BF - who wondered about your lack of warm weather trousers.
The ex-Air Force guy, who gave you a pair of runners.

Monday 8 May - arrive in Montreal


Late May - day trip to Organise in Toronto

Mid June - week trip to organise along the horse-shoe - Toronto to Windsor, visiting Car manufacturers.
Thu 22 June - Telling the US briefing team about your success with uni reps, is met with crickets. They don&#39;t get the polemic you used to try get them to side with LaRouche.
(Your polemic is you can get with LaRouche and reality, or we could start wasting our time making an economy where coffee is piped to everyone&#39;s house and used to keep people warm, drink and bathe in...)

Fri 23 Jun - drive back to Montreal - you get to drive from just before Toronto.

Late June - calling union reps. 
Air problems - told &quot;You are feeling home sick&quot;

Weekend 1&amp;2 July - move offices
You send weekly emails requesting more money for food. The drone is wearing you out. You start jogging every night... starting Mon 3 Jul.

Thu 6 Jul - organising the day after the World cup semi-finals you discover the group that didn&#39;t go to Windsor went to the pub and watched the Australian-Italy match last week. You haven&#39;t even had a beer in Montreal... You feel really left out, skip the after dinner activities to go for a long slow run, looping the big park twice - maybe 10+km.

Mon 10 July - Discover 2 members not contributing to the food fund, but eating the food. You don&#39;t get many allies when you bring it up...

Sun 16 Jul - You get two locals to a meeting/Monge brigade. They stick around all day, sign up to the Cadre School paying. 

Friday 29 July  - Have a break out week - raise $100 in the field 3 days in a row. Better than the time you got 71 signatures in a day at Hawthorn station/Swinburne Uni. - stopped at 71 because it was the year the US dollar left the gold standard.

Weekend 29 &amp; 30 Jul - Cadre School. It is near the US Border and a town called Saint-Bernard... like the dog. (60km South East of Montreal)
5 people from the Boston office drive up. They do all the classes, and spend most of the time talking to the 2 sign ups, so you don&#39;t get a chance to talk to them.

Mon 31 Jul - Two people you signed up for Cadre School run away, demand to not be contacted again!
The Boston team return, not having room for you...

1 Aug - There is a slump in the office. Everyone has a day off, as there is prep for the two going to Vancouver for the Auto Workers convention

2 - 22 Aug - Canadian Auto Workers convention (only the chairman&#39;s son is sent with a local - they take the train, spend first 3 weeks of August away)
You and the office call Union and try to organise etc to support them.
Days feel long, as the humidity is high, heat and showers every day.
No Monge on 6 or 13th.
Food gets bad, you recomend dumpster diving behind a bakery or something, but none is found.

Tuesday 15 Aug - you organise around memorialising 35 years since the dollar was decoupled from gold. - smashed afterwards, because it wasn&#39;t what LaRouche directed needed to happen.
Also the plan for you to travel to Europe is cancelled. - you think it is revenge for you taking leadership.

You start clawing back time.
You remember your reading days in Seattle where you would sit in the University library trying to learn about Mazarine. Here your days of are only spent jogging, and sleeping.

An email about your disastisfaction goes unanswered.

Fri 25 Aug - Sandy ivites you to take the day off with her. You visit a flea market close to the house you are in, and discover your house is a block away from a high School named after JFK.

Sun 27 Aug - Monge brigade is replaced with a Psycho-tourture session on Sandy. It pisses you off because she is your friend, and others probably need to be brought back into line... 
She mentions you having no money or support, as a reason she feels bad...

In september you aren&#39;t given a metro pass. 
The week is a drudge. Organising makes you feel like you&#39;re invisible at the front of campuses... no one stops. You miss reading day, because being on campuses with the new flyer is more important.

2 &amp; 3 Sept - Saturday and Sunday 2 day Monge feels more like everyone talking to their USA friends, whilst you feel isolated not knowing these LA office people.

Fri 8 Sep - LaRouche&#39;s birthday. (!23 Days in Montreal for you).
There is a party, you go for a jog, and get locked out of the office for the third time.

* Your psychosis probably started on this Friday night -

Sat 9 Sep - you sleep in, then go to the library, and use the house phone to rebook your flights...
YOU DON&quot;T TELL ANYONE.

Sunday 10 Sep - You run away... Taking the morning bus to New York, to then catch a flight back to Australia...

You wish you dobbed everyone in at the US border.
Or that you stole a credit card, phone or something...


(125 days in Canada...
It broke you.
The others hate you, and even when you were successful there was nothing for it. You felt like you had no future here. Maybe if you had money already, or were the child of a party member you would have a chance, but instead you are suffering.
You tried to make things better, but you got to the point you couldn&#39;t continue. So you ran away. Afraid if you reached out, the others or controllers would just trick you into staying and doing more of their bidding.
)

===

Monday 11 Sep. (204 days in America)
No one knows where you are. You have no way to communicate with them either.
As you collect your boarding pass, you worry the party noticed and cancelled the changes or something.

(To minimise the ticket cost, you offer to take carry on only, checking carry on is 2 pieces less than 10kg combined - so a laptop bag and backpack is ok).

You cry a little on the flight, as you realise you were alone, and everyone was out to use you for their gains.
Also, you regret recruiting Sandy and getting other people into this thing in the past.
You dream about having a fight with your house mate who you recruited when you joined, that had to leave after discovering he was Bi-polar.
You wish you could had punched up the controllers - the Al, Bruce or even the chairman of the party.

At the layover in a random European city [Rome, Madrid, Helsinki] then Singapore.

At Singapore / Changi you only have 2 hours between flights. Enough time to feel hungry... but not enough to figure out how to exchange money.

All this means our enthusiastic embrace of grit in wildly different contexts may have been premature. For example, most workplaces offer very different challenges to the gruelling – but short-term – Beast Barracks six-week orientation programme. And during a pandemic with no definitive end date, continuing to live on grit alone might be counterintuitive or, at the very least, exhausting.

* That grit - you living rough (no security, no food etc. for the &quot;mission&quot;) exhausted you, and that stress led to your psychotic episode.

 “Extreme cases aside, gritty people tend to be psychologically well adjusted, conscientious and goal directed,” says Houston. But he adds a note of caution: “Like all adaptive traits, too much or too little of a good thing is not a good thing.”
 
 And ultimately, applauding individual grit can’t be grounds for offloading systemic and structural responsibility. According to Sarwar, the cult following for grit at a time of worsening global income inequalities isn’t a coincidence: “It is a way of trying to drag attention back to the individual rather than the larger economic and social structure the individual is embedded in.” </tw-passagedata><tw-passagedata pid="439" name="You know people are talking about you" tags="" position="5425,625" size="100,100">

Thursday 27 May 2004
12:30 introduction of the MARRIAGE LEGISLATION AMENDMENT BILL 2004
Phillip Ruddock - 
&quot;&quot;
..Currently, the Marriage Act 1961 contains no definition of marriage.

It does contain a statement of the legal understanding of marriage in the words that Commonwealth authorised marriage celebrants must say before they solemnise a marriage. Section 46 of the Marriage Act deals with that. Those words are:

Marriage, according to law in Australia, is the union of a man and a woman to the exclusion of all others, voluntarily entered into for life.

The government believes that this is the understanding of marriage held by the vast majority of Australians.

It is time that those words form the formal definition of marriage in the Marriage Act.

This bill will achieve that result.

Including this definition will remove any lingering concerns people may have that the legal definition of marriage may become eroded by time.

A related concern held by many people is that there are now some countries that permit same sex couples to marry...
&quot;&quot;
https://parlinfo.aph.gov.au/parlInfo/search/display/display.w3p;db=CHAMBER;id=chamber%2Fhansardr%2F2004-05-27%2F0069;query=Id%3A%22chamber%2Fhansardr%2F2004-05-27%2F0000%22

And John Howard saying that day:
On 27 May, Howard announced his intention to ban same-sex marriage in legislation.

&quot;We&#39;ve decided to insert this into the Marriage Act to make it very plain that that is our view of a marriage and to also make it very plain that the definition of a marriage is something that should rest in the hands, ultimately, of the parliament of the nation,&quot; he told journalists.

&quot;[Marriage should] not over time be subject to redefinition or change by courts, it is something that ought to be expressed through the elected representatives of the country.&quot;

1) Permanent Population: The country must have a stable population residing within its borders.
2) Defined Territory: It should possess clear and recognized boundaries.
3) Independent Government: The country’s government must operate without being under the authority of another state.
4) Capacity for Interaction: It should be able to engage in diplomatic relations with other sovereign states.</tw-passagedata><tw-passagedata pid="450" name="Perfidy and Ruse of War" tags="" position="4950,925" size="100,100">Ruses of War:

Ruses of war refer to acts that are intended to mislead an adversary or induce them to act recklessly. These actions do not violate any rule of international humanitarian law (IHL) applicable in armed conflict.
Importantly, ruses of war are considered permissible methods of warfare because they do not invite the confidence of an adversary with respect to protection under IHL12.
Examples of ruses include deceptive maneuvers, camouflage, and feigned retreats.
Perfidy:

Perfidy, on the other hand, involves treacherous behavior that violates IHL. It occurs when one party intentionally deceives the enemy by pretending to be a non-combatant or by violating a truce or ceasefire.
Acts of perfidy include using the Red Cross emblem improperly, pretending to surrender, or feigning civilian status to launch an attack.
Perfidy is strictly prohibited under IHL, as it undermines trust and jeopardizes the safety of combatants and civilians alike.
In summary, while ruses of war are acceptable tactics, perfidy crosses the line into unlawful deception during armed conflict. It’s essential to distinguish between the two to ensure compliance with international norms and protect all parties involved3. 

===
Perfidy typically refers to deceit or betrayal, especially in the context of war or conflict. Spoofing IFF (Identification Friend or Foe) emergency codes could indeed be considered perfidious if it leads to harm or undermines trust. IFF systems are critical for identifying friendly forces and preventing accidental attacks. Deliberately manipulating these codes could have serious consequences.

===
Under international law, military aircraft are required to display visible national insignia to distinguish themselves from civilian aircraft and non-combatants. This practice ensures that military aircraft can be readily identified during armed conflict. The criteria for military aircraft include operating under military control, carrying distinct markings, and being manned by air crew subject to military discipline1. From both an operational and legal perspective, these distinctive insignia indicate the aircraft’s military character and nationality2. If combat aircraft lack such markings, it could potentially lead to confusion and raise concerns about perfidy, which involves deceptive actions violating the laws of war.
